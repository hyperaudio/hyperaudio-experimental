NOW YOU'RE RAISING ANOTHER ISSUE

434
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,212
NOW YOU'RE RAISING ANOTHER ISSUE
WHICH GETS LITTLE ATTENTION, AND

435
00:14:37,214 --> 00:14:38,747
WHICH GETS LITTLE ATTENTION, AND
THAT IS THE RACE TO THE BOTTOM.

436
00:14:38,749 --> 00:14:40,315
THAT IS THE RACE TO THE BOTTOM.
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IN THE

437
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:41,349
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IN THE
RECENT YEARS WE HAVE BEEN SEEING

438
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:41,984
RECENT YEARS WE HAVE BEEN SEEING
THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

MANUFACTURING JOBS IN AMERICA,
AND THAT IS GOOD.

441
00:14:44,088 --> 00:14:46,188
AND THAT IS GOOD.
THE BAD NEWS IS THAT SOME OF THE

442
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,223
THE BAD NEWS IS THAT SOME OF THE
JOBS ARE NOW PAYING 50% OR 60%

OF WHAT THESE JOBS USED TO PAY.

444
00:14:50,327 --> 00:14:52,527
OF WHAT THESE JOBS USED TO PAY.
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS

445
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:54,029
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS
CORPORATIONS ARE SAYING, OKAY,

CORPORATIONS ARE SAYING, OKAY,
WELL, WE WILL BRING BACK JOBS,

DEBATE WHEN ASKED THIS, BECAUSE

2386
01:18:34,215 --> 01:18:37,082
DEBATE WHEN ASKED THIS, BECAUSE
SO MUCH OF WHAT GOVERNS FRACKING

2387
01:18:37,084 --> 01:18:39,952
SO MUCH OF WHAT GOVERNS FRACKING
RIGHT NOW IS WITHIN STATE AND

2388
01:18:39,954 --> 01:18:41,753
RIGHT NOW IS WITHIN STATE AND
LOCAL CONTROL, AND THE FEDERAL

2389
01:18:41,755 --> 01:18:46,691
LOCAL CONTROL, AND THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT I THINK THAT IT HAS

2390
01:18:46,693 --> 01:18:48,026
GOVERNMENT I THINK THAT IT HAS
AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY

2391
01:18:48,028 --> 01:18:50,295
AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY
INCLUDING ADVOCATING FOR WHAT

2392
01:18:50,297 --> 01:18:50,929
INCLUDING ADVOCATING FOR WHAT
YOU SAID THAT I HAD PUT FORWARD

2393
01:18:50,931 --> 01:18:51,429
YOU SAID THAT I HAD PUT FORWARD
WHICH IS TO GIVE LOCAL

2394
01:18:51,431 --> 01:18:51,997
WHICH IS TO GIVE LOCAL
COMMUNITIES THE SAY OVER IT.

2395
01:18:51,999 --> 01:18:52,931
COMMUNITIES THE SAY OVER IT.
I ALSO SAID THIS.

2396
01:18:52,933 --> 01:18:55,133
I ALSO SAID THIS.
WE NEED MUCH MORE SCIENTIFIC

2397
01:18:55,135 --> 01:18:55,767
WE NEED MUCH MORE SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH, BUT HERE'S WHAT WE

2398
01:18:55,769 --> 01:18:56,335
RESEARCH, BUT HERE'S WHAT WE
KNOW.

2399
01:18:56,337 --> 01:18:57,903
KNOW.
WE KNOW THAT METHANE RELEASES

2400
01:18:57,905 --> 01:18:58,603
WE KNOW THAT METHANE RELEASES
ARE BAD.

2401
01:18:58,605 --> 01:18:59,437
ARE BAD.
THEY ARE BAD FOR THE

2402
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:04,376
THEY ARE BAD FOR THE
ENVIRONMENT.

2403
01:19:04,378 --> 01:19:05,077
ENVIRONMENT.
THEY ARE BAD FOR GREENHOUSE GAS

2404
01:19:05,079 --> 01:19:07,679
THEY ARE BAD FOR GREENHOUSE GAS
EMISSIONS.

2405
01:19:07,681 --> 01:19:08,213
EMISSIONS.
WE KNOW THAT IF WATER IS

2406
01:19:08,215 --> 01:19:08,847
WE KNOW THAT IF WATER IS
CONTAMINATED, THAT'S BAD, AND WE

2407
01:19:08,849 --> 01:19:12,784
CONTAMINATED, THAT'S BAD, AND WE
CAN'T ALLOW THAT TO GO FORWARD.

2408
01:19:12,786 --> 01:19:22,027
CAN'T ALLOW THAT TO GO FORWARD.
WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A LOOPHOLE

2409
01:19:22,029 --> 01:19:24,062
WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A LOOPHOLE
IN THE LAW THAT I DISAGREE WITH

2410
01:19:24,064 --> 01:19:24,662
IN THE LAW THAT I DISAGREE WITH
THAT PERMITS THE FRACKING

2411
01:19:24,664 --> 01:19:25,197
THAT PERMITS THE FRACKING
COMPANIES TO NOT HAVE TO

2412
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:25,864
COMPANIES TO NOT HAVE TO
DISCLOSE THE CHEMICALS THAT THEY

2413
01:19:25,866 --> 01:19:28,901
DISCLOSE THE CHEMICALS THAT THEY
ARE USING IN FRACKING.

2414
01:19:28,903 --> 01:19:29,434
ARE USING IN FRACKING.
WE DESERVE TO KNOW.

2415
01:19:29,436 --> 01:19:40,078
WE DESERVE TO KNOW.
I THINK WE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW.

2416
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:40,712
I THINK WE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW.
WE DESERVE TO KNOW, AND WE HAVE

2417
01:19:40,714 --> 01:19:41,179
WE DESERVE TO KNOW, AND WE HAVE
A RIGHT TO KNOW.

2418
01:19:41,181 --> 01:19:41,813
A RIGHT TO KNOW.
SO I AM GOING TO PUSH VERY TOUGH

2419
01:19:41,815 --> 01:19:42,014
SO I AM GOING TO PUSH VERY TOUGH
RULES.

2420
01:19:42,016 --> 01:19:42,647
RULES.
NOW I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I

2421
01:19:42,649 --> 01:19:43,282
NOW I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I
CAN DO ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS

2422
01:19:43,284 --> 01:19:43,916
CAN DO ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS
OPPOSED TO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO

2423
01:19:43,918 --> 01:19:44,516
OPPOSED TO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO
HAVE TO WORK ON AT THE STATE

2424
01:19:44,518 --> 01:19:44,716
HAVE TO WORK ON AT THE STATE
LEVEL.

2425
01:19:44,718 --> 01:19:45,317
LEVEL.
OKLAHOMA WHICH IS AS YOU KNOW

2426
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:55,693
OKLAHOMA WHICH IS AS YOU KNOW
HAS BEEN VERY PRO FRACKING HAS

2427
01:19:55,695 --> 01:19:56,328
HAS BEEN VERY PRO FRACKING HAS
SUFFERED FROM TREMORS AND LITTLE

2428
01:19:56,330 --> 01:19:56,929
SUFFERED FROM TREMORS AND LITTLE
EARTHQUAKES AROUND THE STATE.

2429
01:19:56,931 --> 01:20:03,601
EARTHQUAKES AROUND THE STATE.
AND THERE IS GROWING SCIENTIFIC

2430
01:20:03,603 --> 01:20:05,904
AND THERE IS GROWING SCIENTIFIC
EVIDENCE THAT FRACKING IS

2431
01:20:05,906 --> 01:20:06,638
EVIDENCE THAT FRACKING IS
CONNECTED TO, AND I DON'T WANT

2432
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:10,108
CONNECTED TO, AND I DON'T WANT
TO SAY CAUSE, BECAUSE THE

2433
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:10,809
TO SAY CAUSE, BECAUSE THE
SCIENTISTS HAVE NOT REACHED

2434
01:20:10,811 --> 01:20:11,009
SCIENTISTS HAVE NOT REACHED
THAT.

2435
01:20:11,011 --> 01:20:12,577
THAT.
BUT CERTAINLY CONNECTED TO THESE

2436
01:20:12,579 --> 01:20:12,811
BUT CERTAINLY CONNECTED TO THESE
TREMORS.

2437
01:20:12,813 --> 01:20:14,146
TREMORS.
SO NOW EVEN OKLAHOMA IS SAYING

2438
01:20:14,148 --> 01:20:15,613
SO NOW EVEN OKLAHOMA IS SAYING
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE, WE'D BETTER

2439
01:20:15,615 --> 01:20:17,349
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE, WE'D BETTER
STOP AND TAKE A HARD LOOK AT

2440
01:20:17,351 --> 01:20:17,549
STOP AND TAKE A HARD LOOK AT
THIS.

2441
01:20:17,551 --> 01:20:18,883
THIS.
SO I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN AS

2442
01:20:18,885 --> 01:20:20,953
SO I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN AS
PRESIDENT TO SET THE RULES, TO

2443
01:20:20,955 --> 01:20:22,754
PRESIDENT TO SET THE RULES, TO
SET THE REGULATIONS, TO TRY TO

2444
01:20:22,756 --> 01:20:26,624
SET THE REGULATIONS, TO TRY TO
FIGURE OUT HOW TO INFLUENCE

2445
01:20:26,626 --> 01:20:26,959
FIGURE OUT HOW TO INFLUENCE
STATES.

2446
01:20:26,961 --> 01:20:28,393
STATES.
I'M NOT SURE GIVEN THE PRESENT

2447
01:20:28,395 --> 01:20:30,295
I'M NOT SURE GIVEN THE PRESENT
POLITICAL MAKEUP WE COULD PASS A

2448
01:20:30,297 --> 01:20:32,597
POLITICAL MAKEUP WE COULD PASS A
FEDERAL LAW TO END FRACKING, BUT

2449
01:20:32,599 --> 01:20:36,134
FEDERAL LAW TO END FRACKING, BUT
WE SURE CAN TRY TO REGULATE IT

2450
01:20:36,136 --> 01:20:37,535
WE SURE CAN TRY TO REGULATE IT
VERY EFFECTIVELY UNDER THE RULES

2451
01:20:37,537 --> 01:20:39,237
VERY EFFECTIVELY UNDER THE RULES
WE ALREADY HAVE THAT GIVE US

2452
01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:40,405
WE ALREADY HAVE THAT GIVE US
FEDERAL JURISDICTION OVER SOME

2453
01:20:40,407 --> 01:20:43,075
FEDERAL JURISDICTION OVER SOME
OF THESE CHEMICALS AND RELEASES.

2454
01:20:43,077 --> 01:20:44,509
OF THESE CHEMICALS AND RELEASES.
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY

2455
01:20:44,511 --> 01:20:44,809
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY

REGULATE IT AND TO TRY TO LIMIT

2462

IT.

2463
01:20:56,156 --> 01:20:58,290
IT.
NO PRESIDENT CAN STAND UP BEFORE

2464
01:20:58,292 --> 01:20:59,391
NO PRESIDENT CAN STAND UP BEFORE
YOU AND SAY I'M GOING TO BAN IT.

2465
01:20:59,393 --> 01:21:00,125

WE HAVE TOO MANY LAYERS OF LAW

2466

WE HAVE TOO MANY LAYERS OF LAW
THAT WE HAVE TO WORK THROUGH AND

THAT IS 33,000 PEOPLE A YEAR.

2695
01:28:55,434 --> 01:28:56,534

AND THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND

2705
01:29:22,195 --> 01:29:28,632
AND THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND
THAT WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE TO GET

SO I'M NOT SAYING WHAT I PROPOSE

2709
01:29:34,473 --> 01:29:37,575
SO I'M NOT SAYING WHAT I PROPOSE
WILL SOLVE EVERYTHING, BUT I

2710

01:29:42,982 --> 01:29:45,016
ANYTHING, WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE
DOING RIGHT NOW, WILL ONLY LEAD

2714
01:29:45,018 --> 01:29:49,220
DOING RIGHT NOW, WILL ONLY LEAD
TO MORE TERRIBLE LOSS OF LIFE.

2715
01:29:49,222 --> 01:29:50,188
TO MORE TERRIBLE LOSS OF LIFE.

GUNS END UP OR WHAT THEY'RE USED
FOR.

2731

01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:22,653
AND WE'VE GOT TO CRACK DOWN ON
THE MAKERS AND SELLERS OF GUNS.

2733
01:30:22,655 --> 01:30:23,354
THE MAKERS AND SELLERS OF GUNS.
THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

2734
01:30:23,356 --> 01:30:26,824
THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE
FOR THE USE OF THEIR PRODUCTS

2735
01:30:26,826 --> 01:30:28,993
FOR THE USE OF THEIR PRODUCTS
AND EXERCISE MORE CARE AS TO HOW

AND SAY, WHAT ARE WE DOING AS A
COUNTRY?

2768
01:31:38,932 --> 01:31:39,530
COUNTRY?
AND I BELIEVE WHAT I AM

2769
01:31:39,532 --> 01:31:40,364
AND I BELIEVE WHAT I AM
PROPOSING IS COMMON SENSE.

2770
01:31:40,366 --> 01:31:43,234
PROPOSING IS COMMON SENSE.
I AGREE WITH WHAT THE PRESIDENT

01:31:44,838 --> 01:31:47,939
AND THE OBSTACLE IS THE GUN
LOBBY.

2774
01:31:47,941 --> 01:31:49,140
LOBBY.
AND THE GUN LOBBY EXISTS FOR THE

AND THE GUN LOBBY EXISTS FOR THE
PURPOSE OF SCARING AND

01:31:54,413 --> 01:31:55,612
PURPOSE OF SCARING AND
INTIMIDATING PEOPLE INTO DOING

INTIMIDATING PEOPLE INTO DOING
WHAT THEY WANT DONE.

2778
01:31:57,183 --> 01:31:59,583
WHAT THEY WANT DONE.
SO WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW
