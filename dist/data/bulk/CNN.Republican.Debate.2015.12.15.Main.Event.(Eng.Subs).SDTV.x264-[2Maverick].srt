THEY'RE STILL SAYING THIS.
IT IS A CRAZY NOTION.

THE ONLY WAY TO DEFEAT ISIS WITH

THE ONLY WAY TO DEFEAT ISIS WITH
GROUND FORCES MADE UP PRIMARILY

2253
01:07:00,973 --> 01:07:02,539
GROUND FORCES MADE UP PRIMARILY
OF ARAB FORCES.

OF ARAB FORCES.
THOSE NATIONS HAVE CONDUCTED

LESS THAN 5% OF THE AIR STRIKES
AND ACTUALLY NONE SINCE AUGUST.

01:25:45,396 --> 01:25:47,329
ENRICH THEM.
AND THAT'S THE WAY ISIS HAS BEEN

2828
01:25:47,331 --> 01:25:49,498
AND THAT'S THE WAY ISIS HAS BEEN
CREATED AND FORMED HERE.

2829
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,100
CREATED AND FORMED HERE.
ISIS IS CREATED AND FORMED

2830
01:25:51,102 --> 01:25:53,869
ISIS IS CREATED AND FORMED
BECAUSE OF THE ABUSE THAT AL

2831
01:25:53,871 --> 01:25:55,337
BECAUSE OF THE ABUSE THAT AL
ASSAD AND HIS IRANIAN SPONSORS

2832
01:25:55,339 --> 01:25:57,306
ASSAD AND HIS IRANIAN SPONSORS
HAVE RAINED DOWN ON THE SUNNIS

2833
01:25:57,308 --> 01:25:58,507
HAVE RAINED DOWN ON THE SUNNIS
IN SYRIA.

2834
01:25:58,509 --> 01:26:00,509
IN SYRIA.
WHEN WE EMPOWER IRAN THAT'S WHY

2835
01:26:00,511 --> 01:26:01,811
WHEN WE EMPOWER IRAN THAT'S WHY
THIS PRESIDENT -- AND WHEN

2836
01:26:01,813 --> 01:26:03,045
THIS PRESIDENT -- AND WHEN
HILLARY CLINTON SAYS HER THEORY

HILLARY CLINTON SAYS HER THEORY
AGAINST ISIS WILL BE JUST ABOUT

2838
01:26:04,548 --> 01:26:06,448
AGAINST ISIS WILL BE JUST ABOUT
THE SAME AS THE PRESIDENT.

2839
01:26:06,450 --> 01:26:08,317
THE SAME AS THE PRESIDENT.
THEN GET READY FOR MORE UNREST

2840
01:26:08,319 --> 01:26:10,186
THEN GET READY FOR MORE UNREST
AND MORE MURDER AND MORE

01:26:11,355 --> 01:26:13,289
VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
WE NEED TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION

2843
01:26:13,291 --> 01:26:14,356
WE NEED TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION
ON IRAN.

2844
01:26:14,358 --> 01:26:15,724
ON IRAN.
IF YOU MISS IRAN YOU ARE NOT

2845
01:26:15,726 --> 01:26:17,126
IF YOU MISS IRAN YOU ARE NOT
GOING TO GET ISIS.

2846
01:26:17,128 --> 01:26:18,493
GOING TO GET ISIS.
THE TWO ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE

2847
01:26:18,495 --> 01:26:19,829
THE TWO ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE
ONE CAUSES THE OTHER.

01:26:44,922 --> 01:26:46,889
YOUR OWN WEAPONS.
HAD AL ASSAD BEEN BOMBED TWO

2862
01:26:46,891 --> 01:26:50,059
HAD AL ASSAD BEEN BOMBED TWO
YEARS AGO, ISIS WOULD HAVE BEEN

2863
01:26:50,061 --> 01:26:53,462
YEARS AGO, ISIS WOULD HAVE BEEN
IN CHARGE OF ALL OF SYRIA NOW.

01:26:53,464 --> 01:26:55,965
IN CHARGE OF ALL OF SYRIA NOW.
WE NEED A REALISTIC FOREIGN

2866
01:26:58,369 --> 01:27:03,105
POLICY INSTEAD OF A UTOPIAN ONE.
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO LOVE US.

THERE'S NO WAY IF SADDAM HAD NOT
HAD WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION

2871
01:27:12,083 --> 01:27:13,282
HAD WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION
I WOULD HAVE GONE.

2872
01:27:13,284 --> 01:27:14,950

I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE U.S.
SHOULD BE INVOLVED DIRECTLY IN

IN LEBANON.

2877
01:27:22,593 --> 01:27:25,995
IN LEBANON.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

IT NEEDS TO BREAK UP INTO THREE
PARTS.

2885
01:27:37,841 --> 01:27:40,042
