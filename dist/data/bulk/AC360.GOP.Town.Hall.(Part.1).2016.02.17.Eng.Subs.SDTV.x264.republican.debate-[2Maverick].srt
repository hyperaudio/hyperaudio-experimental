A TIME.
FREQUENTLY ELEMENTARY STUDENTS.

FREQUENTLY ELEMENTARY STUDENTS.
AND YOU WOULD SAY, HOW ARE YOU

AND YOU WOULD SAY, HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO 800

IT ACTUALLY WORKED EXTREMELY

946
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:51,461
IT ACTUALLY WORKED EXTREMELY
WELL.

947
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,598
WELL.
BUT, REALLY, THE KEY IS NOT SO

948
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,034
BUT, REALLY, THE KEY IS NOT SO
MUCH THE VOLUME WITH WHICH YOU

MUCH THE VOLUME WITH WHICH YOU
SPEAK.

950
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,937
SPEAK.
BUT IT'S THE CONTENT OF WHAT YOU

951
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:00,104
BUT IT'S THE CONTENT OF WHAT YOU
SAY.

SAY.
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE

953
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:03,440
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE
DIFFERENCE.

954
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:04,975
DIFFERENCE.
AND I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

955
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:07,844
AND I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
ARE SMART ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO

956
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,381
ARE SMART ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO
UNDERSTAND BLUSTER AND RHETORIC

957
00:29:10,383 --> 00:29:11,081
UNDERSTAND BLUSTER AND RHETORIC
VERSUS TRUTH.

958
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:17,154
VERSUS TRUTH.
AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE GENERAL

959
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:18,488
AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE GENERAL
ELECTION, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO

00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:22,226
ARE RUNNING AROUND SAYING THINGS
LIKE, FREE COLLEGE FOR EVERYONE,

962
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:24,861
LIKE, FREE COLLEGE FOR EVERYONE,
IT WILL BE VERY EASY TO COUNTER

963
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,097
IT WILL BE VERY EASY TO COUNTER
THAT BY SIMPLY EDUCATING PEOPLE

964
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:30,334
THAT BY SIMPLY EDUCATING PEOPLE
AS TO THE ACTUAL FINANCIAL

965
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:32,169
AS TO THE ACTUAL FINANCIAL
CONDITION OF OUR NATION.

966
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:33,670

AND THAT'S NOT DONE.

967
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:35,539
AND THAT'S NOT DONE.
I THINK MARGARET THATCHER

968
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:36,974
I THINK MARGARET THATCHER
PROBABLY SAID IT BEST.

969
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:39,443
PROBABLY SAID IT BEST.
SHE SAID SOCIALISM IS GREAT

970
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,011
SHE SAID SOCIALISM IS GREAT
UNTIL YOU RUN OUT OF OTHER

971
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:41,745
UNTIL YOU RUN OUT OF OTHER
PEOPLE'S MONEY.

972
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:43,747
PEOPLE'S MONEY.
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WOULD

973
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,316
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN AND WE WOULD EXPLAIN THAT

974
00:29:45,318 --> 00:29:46,850
HAPPEN AND WE WOULD EXPLAIN THAT
TO PEOPLE, AND I THINK THEY

975
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:47,418
TO PEOPLE, AND I THINK THEY
WOULD UNDERSTAND.

976
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,953
WOULD UNDERSTAND.
SO I LOOK FORWARD TO SUCH A

COLLEGE AND STUDENT DEBT LOANS

DO YOU CURRENTLY THINK THAT'S

DO YOU CURRENTLY THINK THAT'S
THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE COST

1431
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,081
THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE COST

ABOUT STUDENT LOAN DEBT.

1442
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:49,932
ABOUT STUDENT LOAN DEBT.
ONE REASON WHY IS THREE YEARS

1443
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,668
ONE REASON WHY IS THREE YEARS
AGO, I STILL OWED OVER $100,000

1444
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,703
AGO, I STILL OWED OVER $100,000
IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT.

IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT.
I WAS ONLY ABLE TO PAY OFF

I HAVE A BIPARTISAN AGENDA ON

1454
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:09,786
I HAVE A BIPARTISAN AGENDA ON
THIS ISSUE.

1455
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:10,753
THIS ISSUE.
FOUR MAIN THINGS.

1456
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,522
FOUR MAIN THINGS.
THE FIRST IS ALTERNATIVE

1457
00:43:12,524 --> 00:43:12,789
THE FIRST IS ALTERNATIVE
CREDITING.

1458
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:13,989
CREDITING.
TODAY THERE ARE ONLY SIX

1459
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:16,125
TODAY THERE ARE ONLY SIX
ACCREDITING BOARDS IN THE

1460
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:16,358
ACCREDITING BOARDS IN THE
COUNTRY.

1461
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,760
COUNTRY.
YOU CAN ONLY AWARD A FOUR-YEAR

1462
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,261
YOU CAN ONLY AWARD A FOUR-YEAR
DEGREE IF YOU ARE ACREDITED BY

1463
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,130
DEGREE IF YOU ARE ACREDITED BY
ONE OF THESE SIX INSTITUTION.

1464
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:23,399
ONE OF THESE SIX INSTITUTION.
IT'S A MONOPOLY.

1465
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:24,434
IT'S A MONOPOLY.
BECAUSE TODAY IN THE 21st

1466
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:26,602
BECAUSE TODAY IN THE 21st
CENTURY, WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO

1467
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,804
CENTURY, WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO
LEARN MULTIPLE WAYS.

1468
00:43:27,806 --> 00:43:29,539
LEARN MULTIPLE WAYS.
YOU DON'T JUST HAVE TO SIT IN A

1469
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:29,806
YOU DON'T JUST HAVE TO SIT IN A
CLASSROOM.

1470
00:43:29,808 --> 00:43:31,140
CLASSROOM.
THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS TO

1471
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:31,741
THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS TO
ACQUIRE INFORMATION.

1472
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:33,876
ACQUIRE INFORMATION.
AND SO WHAT I PUSH FOR IS AN

1473
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:35,344
AND SO WHAT I PUSH FOR IS AN
ALTERNATIVE ACCREDITING MODLE

1474
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:38,614
ALTERNATIVE ACCREDITING MODLE
THAT ALLOWS ACCREDITED LEARNING.

1475
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,949
THAT ALLOWS ACCREDITED LEARNING.
GIVE PEOPLE CREDIT FOR WHAT

1476
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,951
GIVE PEOPLE CREDIT FOR WHAT
THEY'VE LEARNED THROUGH LIFE

1477
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:42,985
THEY'VE LEARNED THROUGH LIFE
EXPERIENCE, WORK EXPERIENCE,

1478
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:43,553
EXPERIENCE, WORK EXPERIENCE,
MILITARY EXPERIENCE.

1479
00:43:43,555 --> 00:43:45,154
MILITARY EXPERIENCE.
IF YOU HAVE MASTERED A SUBJECT,

1480
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:48,458
IF YOU HAVE MASTERED A SUBJECT,
YOU SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO SIT

1481
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,859
YOU SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO SIT
IN A CLASSROOM AND PAY TO TAKE A

1482
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:52,294
IN A CLASSROOM AND PAY TO TAKE A
COURSE ON SOMETHING YOU ALREADY

1483
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,530
COURSE ON SOMETHING YOU ALREADY
KNOW.

1484
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:56,933
KNOW.
THIS ALTERNATIVE ACCREDITING

1485
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:58,968
THIS ALTERNATIVE ACCREDITING
MODEL WOULD ALLOW US TO DO THIS.

1486
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,670
MODEL WOULD ALLOW US TO DO THIS.
YOU CAN'T USE FINANCIAL AID AND

1487
00:44:00,672 --> 00:44:01,938
YOU CAN'T USE FINANCIAL AID AND
THE PRIVATE SECTOR DOESN'T

1488
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:02,805
THE PRIVATE SECTOR DOESN'T
RECOGNIZE IT.

1489
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,306
RECOGNIZE IT.
I THINK WE NEED TO DO THAT.

1490
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,141
I THINK WE NEED TO DO THAT.
THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR

1491
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,242
THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR
NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS.

1492
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:08,344
NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS.
LET'S SAY THERE'S A SINGLE

1493
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:08,578
LET'S SAY THERE'S A SINGLE
MOTHER.

1494
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:14,617
MOTHER.
SHE MAKES 2 -- $11 AN HOUR.

1495
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:15,952
SHE MAKES 2 -- $11 AN HOUR.
THE ONLY WAY SHE'LL MAKE MORE

1496
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:17,353
THE ONLY WAY SHE'LL MAKE MORE
MONEY IS TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

1497
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:18,821
MONEY IS TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.
BUT SHE HAS TO WORK FULL TIME

1498
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,389
BUT SHE HAS TO WORK FULL TIME
DURING THE DAY AND RAISE HER

1499
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:21,056
DURING THE DAY AND RAISE HER
KIDS AT NIGHT.

1500
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:24,426
KIDS AT NIGHT.
IF THERE WAS AN ALTERNATIVE

1501
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,963
IF THERE WAS AN ALTERNATIVE
ACCREDITING MODEL THAT ALLOWED

1502
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:29,599
ACCREDITING MODEL THAT ALLOWED
HER TO EARN CREDITS THROUGH WHAT

1503
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:31,968
HER TO EARN CREDITS THROUGH WHAT
SHE LEARNED ON HER YEARS ON THE

1504
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:33,903
SHE LEARNED ON HER YEARS ON THE
JOB IT WOULD SHORTEN THAT TIME

1505
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:35,437
JOB IT WOULD SHORTEN THAT TIME
IF NOT ALLOW HER TO COMPLETE

1506
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,272
IF NOT ALLOW HER TO COMPLETE
THAT DEGREE.

1507
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:38,808
THAT DEGREE.
ALTERNATIVE ACCREDITING THAT

1508
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,376
ALTERNATIVE ACCREDITING THAT
ALLOWS YOU TO GET THE MAXIMUM

1509
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:42,211
ALLOWS YOU TO GET THE MAXIMUM
AMOUNT OF CREDITS WITHOUT HAVING

1510
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:44,514
AMOUNT OF CREDITS WITHOUT HAVING
TO PAY FOR IT IN AN INSTITUTION.

1511
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:45,882
TO PAY FOR IT IN AN INSTITUTION.
AND THE STUDENT INVESTMENT PLAN.

1512
00:44:45,884 --> 00:44:47,783
AND THE STUDENT INVESTMENT PLAN.
THIS WOULD ALLOW YOU TO GO TO A

1513
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:49,852
THIS WOULD ALLOW YOU TO GO TO A
PRIVATE INVESTMENT GROUP WHO

1514
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,587
PRIVATE INVESTMENT GROUP WHO
WOULD INVEST IN YOU THE WAY AN

1515
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:53,055
WOULD INVEST IN YOU THE WAY AN
INVESTMENT GROUP INVESTS IN A

1516
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:53,422
INVESTMENT GROUP INVESTS IN A
BUSINESS.

1517
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:54,557
BUSINESS.
THEY WOULD BELIEVE IN YOU SO

1518
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:56,358
THEY WOULD BELIEVE IN YOU SO
MUCH AND IN YOUR SUCCESS THAT

1519
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,093
MUCH AND IN YOUR SUCCESS THAT
THEY WOULD PAY FOR YOUR COLLEGE.

1520
00:44:58,095 --> 00:44:59,695
THEY WOULD PAY FOR YOUR COLLEGE.
IF YOU BECOME FINANCIALLY

1521
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,296
IF YOU BECOME FINANCIALLY
SUCCESSFUL, THEY'LL MAKE THEIR

1522
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:02,364
SUCCESSFUL, THEY'LL MAKE THEIR
INVESTMENT BACK WITH A PROFIT.

1523
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,567
INVESTMENT BACK WITH A PROFIT.
IF YOU DO NOT, THEY'LL LOSE

1524
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:06,135
IF YOU DO NOT, THEY'LL LOSE
THEIR MONEY AND MADE A BAD

1525
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:06,435
THEIR MONEY AND MADE A BAD
INVESTMENT.

1526
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:07,870
INVESTMENT.
BUT ALL THE RISK IS ON THEM.

1527
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:10,506
BUT ALL THE RISK IS ON THEM.
THE THIRD IS TO MAKE

1528
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:11,641
THE THIRD IS TO MAKE
INCOME-BASED REPAYMENT.

1529
00:45:11,643 --> 00:45:13,442
INCOME-BASED REPAYMENT.
I HAVE THAT LAW RIGHT NOW THAT

1530
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,044
I HAVE THAT LAW RIGHT NOW THAT
I'M WORKING ON WITH MARK WARNER,

1531
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:16,211
I'M WORKING ON WITH MARK WARNER,
A DEMOCRAT FROM VIRGINIA.

1532
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,880
A DEMOCRAT FROM VIRGINIA.
WHY THAT IS IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE

1533
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,182
WHY THAT IS IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE
I WOULD RATHER COLLECT $20 A

1534
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:21,450
I WOULD RATHER COLLECT $20 A
MONTH FROM A STUDENT THAN

1535
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:21,684
MONTH FROM A STUDENT THAN
NOTHING.

1536
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:23,586
NOTHING.
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE COLLECTING

1537
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:25,187
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE COLLECTING
$20, AT LEAST YOU ARE COLLECTING

1538
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,423
$20, AT LEAST YOU ARE COLLECTING
$20 AND THEY AREN'T DEFAULTING

1539
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:28,323
$20 AND THEY AREN'T DEFAULTING
ON THE DEBT.

1540
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:30,726
ON THE DEBT.
IF YOU DEFAULT THAT RUINS YOUR

1541
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:30,960
IF YOU DEFAULT THAT RUINS YOUR
CREDIT.

1542
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:32,161
CREDIT.
YOU CAN'T BUY A HOUSE.

1543
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:33,495
YOU CAN'T BUY A HOUSE.
IT REALLY HURTS YOU.

1544
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,230
IT REALLY HURTS YOU.
AND RIGHT TO KNOW BEFORE YOU GO

1545
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,900
AND RIGHT TO KNOW BEFORE YOU GO

WYDEN, THE DEMOCRAT FROM OREGON.

1547
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:41,003
WYDEN, THE DEMOCRAT FROM OREGON.
BEFORE YOU TAKE OUT A LOAN,

1548
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:42,371
BEFORE YOU TAKE OUT A LOAN,
SCHOOLS HAVE TO TELL YOU HOW

1549
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:43,873
SCHOOLS HAVE TO TELL YOU HOW
MUCH PEOPLE MAKE WHEN THEY

1550
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:45,374
MUCH PEOPLE MAKE WHEN THEY
GRADUATE FROM THAT SCHOOL WITH A

1551
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:46,208
GRADUATE FROM THAT SCHOOL WITH A
DEGREE YOU'RE SEEKING.

1552
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,777
DEGREE YOU'RE SEEKING.
WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT?

1553
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:49,745
WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT?
IT WILL PROBABLY TEACH YOU THE

1554
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,814
IT WILL PROBABLY TEACH YOU THE
MARKET FOR ROMAN PHILOSOPHERS

1555
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:52,949
MARKET FOR ROMAN PHILOSOPHERS
HAS TIGHTENED.

1556
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:55,551
HAS TIGHTENED.
SO YOU MAY NOT WANT TO BORROW

1557
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:56,819
SO YOU MAY NOT WANT TO BORROW

SAFE AS WE POSSIBLY CAN.

2821
01:19:28,698 --> 01:19:31,599

FOOTBALL HAS INHERENT DANGER.

2822
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:35,102
FOOTBALL HAS INHERENT DANGER.
SO DOES COMPETITIVE STUNT

2823
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:35,436
SO DOES COMPETITIVE STUNT
CHEERLEADING.

2824
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,305
CHEERLEADING.
SO DOES DRIVING A CAR BACK AND

2825

SO DOES DRIVING A CAR BACK AND
FORTH TO WORK.

2826
01:19:38,207 --> 01:19:40,040
FORTH TO WORK.
I ULTIMATELY THINK FOOTBALL IS

2827
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:41,041
I ULTIMATELY THINK FOOTBALL IS
AN INCREDIBLE SPORT.

2828
01:19:41,043 --> 01:19:42,943
AN INCREDIBLE SPORT.
IT TEACHES LESSONS, LIFE LESSONS

2829
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:44,412
IT TEACHES LESSONS, LIFE LESSONS
THAT I THINK ARE VALUABLE.

2830
01:19:44,414 --> 01:19:46,180
THAT I THINK ARE VALUABLE.
YOU CAN MAKE THE GAME SAFER.

2831
01:19:46,182 --> 01:19:47,881
YOU CAN MAKE THE GAME SAFER.
YOU CAN NEVER MAKE IT ENTIRELY

2832
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:48,115
YOU CAN NEVER MAKE IT ENTIRELY
SAFE.

2833
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:50,117
SAFE.
AND SO YOU DO SPEND A LOT OF

2834
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,686
AND SO YOU DO SPEND A LOT OF
TIME COACHING KIDS HOW TO

2835
01:19:51,688 --> 01:19:53,521
TIME COACHING KIDS HOW TO
PROPERLY TACKLE, NOT USE YOUR

HEAD.

2837
01:19:53,856 --> 01:19:56,290
HEAD.
VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHEN I WAS

2838
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:56,957
VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHEN I WAS
GROWING UP AND THEY TAUGHT YOU

2839
01:19:56,959 --> 01:19:57,891
GROWING UP AND THEY TAUGHT YOU
TO USE YOUR HEAD.

2840
01:19:57,893 --> 01:19:59,360
TO USE YOUR HEAD.
AND THE DEMOCRATS SAY THAT

THAT'S NOT TRUE.

2844
01:20:01,931 --> 01:20:04,665
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
MY POINT IS IT'S A SPORT THAT

2845
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:06,567
MY POINT IS IT'S A SPORT THAT
BRINGS INHERENT DANGER, BUT SO

2846
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:07,368
BRINGS INHERENT DANGER, BUT SO
DOES LIFE.
