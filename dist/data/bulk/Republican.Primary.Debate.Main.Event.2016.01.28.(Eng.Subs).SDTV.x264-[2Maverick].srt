DO YOU FAVOR THE IDEA THAT

2839
01:19:34,695 --> 01:19:35,560
DO YOU FAVOR THE IDEA THAT
ABORTION SHOULD BE A STATES

2840
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:36,395
ABORTION SHOULD BE A STATES
RIGHTS ISSUE AND IF A LIBERAL

2841
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:38,363
RIGHTS ISSUE AND IF A LIBERAL
STATE WANTS TO MAKE IT LEGAL,

2842
01:19:38,365 --> 01:19:39,364
STATE WANTS TO MAKE IT LEGAL,
THAT THAT'S THEIR CHOICE?

2843
01:19:39,366 --> 01:19:40,532
THAT THAT'S THEIR CHOICE?
YES OR NO?

2844
01:19:40,534 --> 01:19:41,100
YES OR NO?
>> BOTH.

2845
01:19:41,102 --> 01:19:42,234
>> BOTH.
BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE APPROACH.

2846
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:43,368
BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE APPROACH.
I HAVE SAID THAT WE COULD LEAVE

2847
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:45,237
I HAVE SAID THAT WE COULD LEAVE
IT TO THE STATES BUT I'VE ALSO

2848
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:46,906
IT TO THE STATES BUT I'VE ALSO
INTRODUCED A FEDERAL SOLUTION AS

2849
01:19:46,908 --> 01:19:47,339
INTRODUCED A FEDERAL SOLUTION AS
WELL.

2850
01:19:47,341 --> 01:19:48,607
WELL.
SO THE FEDERAL SOLUTION WOULD BE

2851
01:19:48,609 --> 01:19:50,342
SO THE FEDERAL SOLUTION WOULD BE
THE LIFE AT CONCEPTION ACT WHICH

2852
01:19:50,344 --> 01:19:52,044
THE LIFE AT CONCEPTION ACT WHICH
IS AN ACT THAT WOULD FEDERALIZE

2853
01:19:52,046 --> 01:19:52,744
IS AN ACT THAT WOULD FEDERALIZE
THE ISSUE.

2854
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:54,313
THE ISSUE.
BUT I'VE ALSO SAID FOR THE MOST

2855
01:19:54,315 --> 01:19:56,548
BUT I'VE ALSO SAID FOR THE MOST
PART THESE ISSUES WOULD BE LEFT

2856
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:57,283
PART THESE ISSUES WOULD BE LEFT
BACK TO THE STATES.

2857
01:19:57,285 --> 01:19:58,851
BACK TO THE STATES.
SO THERE MIGHT BE AN OCCASION IF

2858
01:19:58,853 --> 01:20:01,486
SO THERE MIGHT BE AN OCCASION IF
WE DID OVERTURN ROE V. WADE, ROE

2859
01:20:01,488 --> 01:20:02,421
WE DID OVERTURN ROE V. WADE, ROE
V. WADE NATIONALIZED THE ISSUE.

2860
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:04,323
V. WADE NATIONALIZED THE ISSUE.
IF YOU HAD THE COURT REVERSE ROE

2861
01:20:04,325 --> 01:20:05,557
IF YOU HAD THE COURT REVERSE ROE
V. WADE, IT WOULD BECOME A STATE

2862
01:20:05,559 --> 01:20:06,091
V. WADE, IT WOULD BECOME A STATE
ISSUE ONCE AGAIN.

2863
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:08,260

I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER THE

2864
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:09,494
I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER THE
LESS ABORTIONS WE HAVE SO THE

2865
01:20:09,496 --> 01:20:11,630
LESS ABORTIONS WE HAVE SO THE
MORE STATES THAT WE HAVE THAT

2866
01:20:11,632 --> 01:20:13,232
MORE STATES THAT WE HAVE THAT
MADE ABORTION ILLEGAL, THE
