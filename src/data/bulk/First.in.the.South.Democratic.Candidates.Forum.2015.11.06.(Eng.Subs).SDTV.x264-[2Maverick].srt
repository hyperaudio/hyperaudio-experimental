RIGHT NOW WHERE BOTH OUR
DEMOCRACY AND OUR ECONOMY ARE

2505
01:10:21,652 --> 01:10:24,520
DEMOCRACY AND OUR ECONOMY ARE
NOT WORKING FOR THE MAJORITY.

2506
01:10:24,522 --> 01:10:28,090
NOT WORKING FOR THE MAJORITY.
THEY'RE WORKING FOR A SELECT

2507
01:10:28,092 --> 01:10:29,258
THEY'RE WORKING FOR A SELECT
MINORITY VERY, VERY WELL.

2508
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:31,827
MINORITY VERY, VERY WELL.
AND WHAT I WANT TO DO AS

2509
01:10:31,829 --> 01:10:33,562
AND WHAT I WANT TO DO AS
PRESIDENT IS TO MAKE THAT CASE

2510
01:10:33,564 --> 01:10:35,464
PRESIDENT IS TO MAKE THAT CASE
BUT TO MAKE IT IN A WAY THAT

2511
01:10:35,466 --> 01:10:38,700
BUT TO MAKE IT IN A WAY THAT
PEOPLE WILL HEAR IT.

2512
01:10:38,702 --> 01:10:39,435
PEOPLE WILL HEAR IT.
I'M WELL AWARE THAT PARTICULARLY

2513
01:10:39,437 --> 01:10:40,136
I'M WELL AWARE THAT PARTICULARLY
IN THE SOUTH I THINK A LOT OF

2514
01:10:40,138 --> 01:10:41,737
IN THE SOUTH I THINK A LOT OF
PEOPLE AGREE WITH ME THAT

2515
01:10:41,739 --> 01:10:42,805
PEOPLE AGREE WITH ME THAT
THERE'S TOO MUCH POWER INVESTED

2516
01:10:42,807 --> 01:10:43,539
THERE'S TOO MUCH POWER INVESTED
IN TOO FEW HANDS.

2517
01:10:43,541 --> 01:10:45,774
IN TOO FEW HANDS.
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THEY MAY

2518
01:10:45,776 --> 01:10:47,209
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THEY MAY
NOT ALWAYS AGREE WITH THE

2519
01:10:47,211 --> 01:10:48,477
NOT ALWAYS AGREE WITH THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY ABOUT WHAT

NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT IT.
SO WHAT I WANT IS A REAL

HERE'S WHAT I'VE SAID.
THE VAST MAJORITY OF DEATH

2582
01:12:21,439 --> 01:12:25,107
THE VAST MAJORITY OF DEATH
PENALTY CASE, AS YOU KNOW, ARISE

OUT OF STATE JUDICIAL
PROCEEDINGS.

2585
01:12:27,878 --> 01:12:29,111
PROCEEDINGS.
AND I DO THINK A NUMBER OF

2586
01:12:29,113 --> 01:12:31,113
AND I DO THINK A NUMBER OF
STATES, AGAIN, PREDOMINANTLY BUT

2587
01:12:31,115 --> 01:12:35,518
STATES, AGAIN, PREDOMINANTLY BUT
NOT EXCLUSIVELY IN THE SOUTH

2588
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,485
NOT EXCLUSIVELY IN THE SOUTH
HAVE MOVED MUCH TOO QUICKLY TO

TRY PEOPLE FOR CAPITAL OFFENSES
THAT CARRY THE DEATH PENALTY.

2591
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:40,989
THAT CARRY THE DEATH PENALTY.
AND THE DEATH ROWS IN A NUMBER

2592
01:12:40,991 --> 01:12:43,625
AND THE DEATH ROWS IN A NUMBER
OF SOUTHERN STATES ARE STILL

2593
01:12:43,627 --> 01:12:44,860
OF SOUTHERN STATES ARE STILL
QUITE POPULATED EVEN THOUGH

2594

QUITE POPULATED EVEN THOUGH
PEOPLE GO THROUGH THEIR JUDICIAL

2595
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:49,598
PEOPLE GO THROUGH THEIR JUDICIAL
REMEDIES.

2596
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,533
REMEDIES.
AND I DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN

2597
01:12:50,535 --> 01:12:52,435
AND I DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN
MAKE A CASE THAT ALL THAT NEEDED

2598
01:12:52,437 --> 01:12:54,603
MAKE A CASE THAT ALL THAT NEEDED
TO BE DONE TO PROTECT AGAINST

01:12:54,605 --> 01:12:56,572
TO BE DONE TO PROTECT AGAINST
DISCRIMINATION AND UNFAIRNESS

AND LACK OF DUE PROCESS HAS BEEN
DONE.

2602
01:12:58,242 --> 01:13:00,176

SO I THINK STATES SHOULD TAKE A

2603
01:13:00,178 --> 01:13:01,610
SO I THINK STATES SHOULD TAKE A
REALLY HARD LOOK AT THIS.

COURT SAID NO, IT VIOLATES THE

2606

EIGHTH AMENDMENT, IT'S CRUEL AND

EIGHTH AMENDMENT, IT'S CRUEL AND
UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT, I WOULD

UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT, I WOULD
BREATHE A SIGH OF RELIEF ABOUT

2609
01:13:10,921 --> 01:13:12,288
BREATHE A SIGH OF RELIEF ABOUT
THAT BECAUSE I THINK MANY STATES

2610
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:13,222
THAT BECAUSE I THINK MANY STATES
HAVE GONE WAY TOO FAR.

2611
01:13:13,224 --> 01:13:15,157
HAVE GONE WAY TOO FAR.
