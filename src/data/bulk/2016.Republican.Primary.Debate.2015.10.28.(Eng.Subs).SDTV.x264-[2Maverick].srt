THAT IS REALLY THE THEME OF WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

3021
01:39:46,868 --> 01:39:50,470
I'M TALKING ABOUT.
HOW DO WE USE OUR INTELLECTUAL

01:39:50,472 --> 01:39:52,505
HOW DO WE USE OUR INTELLECTUAL
ABILITIES RATHER THAN ALLOW THE

3023
01:39:52,507 --> 01:39:55,007
ABILITIES RATHER THAN ALLOW THE
