ABSOLUTELY FINISH THE WALL AND
GUARD THE BORDER.

626
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:55,457
GUARD THE BORDER.
AND IF ANYBODY WERE TO COME IN

AND IF ANYBODY WERE TO COME IN
AFTER THAT, THEY ARE GOING TO

HAVE TO GO BACK.
NO EXCUSES BECAUSE WE CAN'T

NO EXCUSES BECAUSE WE CAN'T
CONTINUE THIS PROBLEM.

COMMITTED A CRIME, SINCE THEY'VE

COMMITTED A CRIME, SINCE THEY'VE
BEEN HERE, THEY GET A PATH TO

HORRIBLE TRADE DEALS.
THE JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE

1616
00:43:03,266 --> 00:43:03,598
THE JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE
DISAPPEARING.

00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,333
DISAPPEARING.
AND ESPECIALLY THE GOOD JOBS.

SO THAT PRESIDENTS AND
POLITICIANS LOOK GOOD.

1622
00:43:11,274 --> 00:43:12,907
POLITICIANS LOOK GOOD.
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE LOOKING FOR

ALL OF THESE PEOPLE LOOKING FOR
JOBS, WHEN THEY GIVE UP, THEY GO

1624
00:43:14,711 --> 00:43:16,377
JOBS, WHEN THEY GIVE UP, THEY GO
HOME, THEY GIVE UP AND THEY ARE

1625

00:43:18,615 --> 00:43:21,182
SO THAT'S THAT.
BUT I WILL SAY, TRADE DEALS ARE

1629
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:23,150
BUT I WILL SAY, TRADE DEALS ARE
ABSOLUTELY KILLING OUR COUNTRY.

DON'T PLAY THE GAME.

1635
00:43:31,027 --> 00:43:32,827
DON'T PLAY THE GAME.
AND THE ONLY WAY WE'LL BE ABLE

1636
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:35,396
AND THE ONLY WAY WE'LL BE ABLE
TO DO IT IS WE'LL HAVE TO DO

1637
00:43:35,398 --> 00:43:37,231
TO DO IT IS WE'LL HAVE TO DO
TAXES UNLESS THEY BEHAVE.

1638
00:43:37,233 --> 00:43:38,566
TAXES UNLESS THEY BEHAVE.
IF YOU DON'T TAX CERTAIN

1639

IF YOU DON'T TAX CERTAIN
PRODUCTS COMING INTO THIS

UNITED STATES AND LAUGHING AT

1643
00:43:43,707 --> 00:43:45,206
UNITED STATES AND LAUGHING AT
OUR STUPIDITY, WE'RE GOING TO

1644

CONTINUE TO LOSE BUSINESSES AND

1645
00:43:46,643 --> 00:43:48,543

AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE AVERAGE

1648
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,279
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE AVERAGE
WORKER OVER THE LAST 12 YEARS,

1649
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:54,148
WORKER OVER THE LAST 12 YEARS,
THEIR SALARY AND PAY HAVE GONE

1650

IT'S GONE DOWN.

1652
00:43:55,752 --> 00:43:58,052
IT'S GONE DOWN.
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY THERE'S

1653
00:43:58,054 --> 00:44:00,054
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY THERE'S
BEEN SUCH AN OUTPOURING OF LOVE

BEEN SUCH AN OUTPOURING OF LOVE

CANDIDATES WHO PROPOSE TARIFFS.
AND THE EFFECT OF A 45% TARIFF

1681
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:47,468
AND THE EFFECT OF A 45% TARIFF
WOULD BE WHEN YOU GO TO THE

WHEN YOU PUT THOSE IN PLACE

WHEN YOU PUT THOSE IN PLACE
BECAUSE A TARIFF IS A TAX ON

BECAUSE A TARIFF IS A TAX ON
YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, BUT

OUR IMPORTS, WOULD NOT RAISE
PRICES FOR AMERICANS AND WOULD

THE MAPS SAY YOU CAN ONLY BECOME

3356
01:38:01,862 --> 01:38:07,431
THE MAPS SAY YOU CAN ONLY BECOME
THE NOMINEE IF IN FACT THERE IS

3357
01:38:07,433 --> 01:38:09,200
THE NOMINEE IF IN FACT THERE IS
A CONTESTED VECONVENTION.

3358
01:38:09,202 --> 01:38:10,068
A CONTESTED VECONVENTION.
WHY SHOULDN'T THE PERSON WITH

3359
01:38:10,070 --> 01:38:11,602
WHY SHOULDN'T THE PERSON WITH
THE MOST DELEGATES, EVEN IF IT'S

3360
01:38:11,604 --> 01:38:13,804
THE MOST DELEGATES, EVEN IF IT'S
NOT A MAJORITY OF DELEGATES BE

STORY IN POLITICS.

3364
01:38:17,210 --> 01:38:18,542
STORY IN POLITICS.
THE GREAT THING ABOUT POLITICS,

3365
01:38:18,544 --> 01:38:21,145
THE GREAT THING ABOUT POLITICS,
THE REASON WHY WE WATCH IT IS

3366
01:38:21,147 --> 01:38:22,813
THE REASON WHY WE WATCH IT IS
BECAUSE WHAT'S TRUE TODAY IS NOT

3367
01:38:22,815 --> 01:38:23,647
BECAUSE WHAT'S TRUE TODAY IS NOT
NECESSARILY TRUE TOMORROW SO

3368
01:38:23,649 --> 01:38:25,049
NECESSARILY TRUE TOMORROW SO
LET'S NOT GET AHEAD OF

3369
01:38:25,051 --> 01:38:25,383
LET'S NOT GET AHEAD OF
OURSELVES.

3370
01:38:25,385 --> 01:38:27,218
OURSELVES.
SECONDLY, LOOK, WHEN YOU WENT TO

3371
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:29,387
SECONDLY, LOOK, WHEN YOU WENT TO
SCHOOL UP THERE IN SALEM, OHIO,

3372
01:38:29,389 --> 01:38:31,923
SCHOOL UP THERE IN SALEM, OHIO,
OKAY, IF YOU GOT AN 86, YOU GOT

3373
01:38:31,925 --> 01:38:32,423
OKAY, IF YOU GOT AN 86, YOU GOT
A B.

3374
01:38:32,425 --> 01:38:34,192
A B.
BECAUSE EVERYBODY ELSE HAD AN 84

3375
01:38:34,194 --> 01:38:37,362
BECAUSE EVERYBODY ELSE HAD AN 84
DIDN'T MEAN YOU GOT AN A.

3376
01:38:37,364 --> 01:38:38,329
DIDN'T MEAN YOU GOT AN A.
SO YOU JUST HAVE TO WIN ENOUGH

3377
01:38:38,331 --> 01:38:40,464
SO YOU JUST HAVE TO WIN ENOUGH
DELEGATES TO BE THE NOMINEE.

AND, FRANKLY, I DON'T KNOW IF

3379
01:38:41,601 --> 01:38:42,934

WE'RE GOING TO GET A CONVENTION

01:38:42,936 --> 01:38:46,170
WE'RE GOING TO GET A CONVENTION
LIKE THAT BUT IF WE DO, I WAS AT

3381
01:38:46,172 --> 01:38:52,176
LIKE THAT BUT IF WE DO, I WAS AT
ONE IN 1976 AS A WEE LAD AND

3382
01:38:52,178 --> 01:38:54,178
ONE IN 1976 AS A WEE LAD AND
SUPPORTED RONALD REAGAN AND

3383
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:56,981
SUPPORTED RONALD REAGAN AND
WORKED HIM.

WORKED HIM.
HE LOST, GERALD FORD SERVED THE

3385
01:39:02,088 --> 01:39:06,190
HE LOST, GERALD FORD SERVED THE
COUNTRY BY PARDONING RICHARD

COUNTRY.

3388
01:39:10,430 --> 01:39:11,996
COUNTRY.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO

3389
01:39:11,998 --> 01:39:12,230
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN.

3390
01:39:12,232 --> 01:39:13,965

WE STILL HAVE ABOUT HALF THE

3391
01:39:13,967 --> 01:39:15,199
WE STILL HAVE ABOUT HALF THE
DELEGATES TO BE SELECTED.

3392
01:39:15,201 --> 01:39:16,500
DELEGATES TO BE SELECTED.
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO BE A VERY

3393
01:39:16,502 --> 01:39:18,136
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO BE A VERY
INTERESTING THING TO SEE HOW IT

TWO OF US UP HERE THAT CAN AND

MEANT TO BE A CRITICISM, THAT'S
JUST A MATHEMATICAL FACT, OKAY?

JUST A MATHEMATICAL FACT, OKAY?
IF TWO OF US GET UP THERE, I

NUMBER THAT WAS SET BY SOMEBODY,

NUMBER THAT WAS SET BY SOMEBODY,
WHICH IS A VERY RANDOM NUMBER, I
