DOLLARS THEY'RE SPENDING ON
WELFARE, ON PRISONS, ON

430
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,424
WELFARE, ON PRISONS, ON
EDUCATION, ALL OF THOSE HAVE

431
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:03,126
EDUCATION, ALL OF THOSE HAVE
DROPPED BY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

432
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:04,761
DROPPED BY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS, AND THE AMERICANS,

433
00:15:04,763 --> 00:15:07,664
OF DOLLARS, AND THE AMERICANS,
AND FOR THAT MATTER, THE LEGAL

434
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,100
AND FOR THAT MATTER, THE LEGAL
IMMIGRANTS, WHO ARE IN ARIZONA,

435
00:15:10,102 --> 00:15:11,200
IMMIGRANTS, WHO ARE IN ARIZONA,
ARE SEEING UNEMPLOYMENT DROP,

436
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,802
ARE SEEING UNEMPLOYMENT DROP,

437
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:13,937

LEGAL IMMIGRANTS, BUT I THINK IT

441
00:15:18,343 --> 00:15:20,543
LEGAL IMMIGRANTS, BUT I THINK IT
IS A MISTAKE TO FORGIVE THOSE

442
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,812
IS A MISTAKE TO FORGIVE THOSE
WHO BREAK THE LAW, TO ALLOW THEM

443
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:24,347
WHO BREAK THE LAW, TO ALLOW THEM
TO BECOME U.S. CITIZENS, AND

444
00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:26,683
TO BECOME U.S. CITIZENS, AND
THAT'S WHY I'VE LED THE FIGHT

445
00:15:26,685 --> 00:15:28,718
THAT'S WHY I'VE LED THE FIGHT
AGAINST GRANTING CITIZENSHIP TO

SECURE THE BORDER.
AND THAT'S NOT JUST THE PHYSICAL

478
00:16:19,337 --> 00:16:20,336
AND THAT'S NOT JUST THE PHYSICAL
BORDER WITH MEXICO.

THAT'S 45% OF THE PROBLEM RIGHT

00:16:24,242 --> 00:16:24,440
THAT'S 45% OF THE PROBLEM RIGHT
THERE.

482
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,609

THE DOING ANYTHING ELSE.

488
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:33,549
THE DOING ANYTHING ELSE.
AND THEN WE'LL SEE WHAT THE

489
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:34,584
AND THEN WE'LL SEE WHAT THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO

00:16:34,586 --> 00:16:34,818
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO
SUPPORT.

00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,285
SUPPORT.
AND DONALD MENTIONED, BECAUSE HE

492
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,520
AND DONALD MENTIONED, BECAUSE HE
MENTIONED ME IN HIS ANSWER, THAT

00:16:37,522 --> 00:16:38,621
MENTIONED ME IN HIS ANSWER, THAT
HIS POSITION ON IMMIGRATION IS

494
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:39,388
HIS POSITION ON IMMIGRATION IS
WHAT'S DRIVEN THIS DEBATE.

495
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,790
WHAT'S DRIVEN THIS DEBATE.
THE TRUTH IS, THOUGH, A LOT OF

496
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:41,925
THE TRUTH IS, THOUGH, A LOT OF
THESE POSITIONS THAT HE'S NOW

00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:43,193
THESE POSITIONS THAT HE'S NOW
TAKE RG NEW TO HIM.

498
00:16:43,195 --> 00:16:44,594
TAKE RG NEW TO HIM.
IN 2011, HE TALKED ABOUT THE

499
00:16:44,596 --> 00:16:46,830
IN 2011, HE TALKED ABOUT THE
NEED FOR A PATHWAY TO

500
00:16:46,832 --> 00:16:47,230
NEED FOR A PATHWAY TO
CITIZENSHIP.

501
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:48,732
CITIZENSHIP.
IN 2012, DONALD CRITICIZED MITT

502
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:51,101
IN 2012, DONALD CRITICIZED MITT
ROMNEY, SAYING THAT MITT LOST

503
00:16:51,103 --> 00:16:51,901
ROMNEY, SAYING THAT MITT LOST
HIS ELECTION BECAUSE OF

504
00:16:51,903 --> 00:16:52,301
HIS ELECTION BECAUSE OF
SELF-DEPORTATION.

505
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,536
SELF-DEPORTATION.
AND EVEN TODAY, WE SAW A REPORT

506
00:16:53,538 --> 00:16:54,904
AND EVEN TODAY, WE SAW A REPORT
IN ONE OF THE NEWSPAPERS THAT

507
00:16:54,906 --> 00:16:55,972
IN ONE OF THE NEWSPAPERS THAT
DONALD, YOU'VE HIRED A

508
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:56,606
DONALD, YOU'VE HIRED A
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE

509
00:16:56,608 --> 00:16:58,908
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE
FROM OTHER COUNTRIES TO TAKE

510
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,077
FROM OTHER COUNTRIES TO TAKE
JOBS THAT AMERICANS COULD HAVE

511
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:01,310
JOBS THAT AMERICANS COULD HAVE
FILLED.

512
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,213
FILLED.
MY MOM WAS A MADE AT A HOTEL,

513
00:17:03,215 --> 00:17:04,280
MY MOM WAS A MADE AT A HOTEL,
AND INSTEAD OF HIRING AN

514
00:17:04,282 --> 00:17:05,281
AND INSTEAD OF HIRING AN
AMERICAN LIKE HER, YOU HAVE

515
00:17:05,283 --> 00:17:06,449
AMERICAN LIKE HER, YOU HAVE
BROUGHT IN OVER A THOUSAND

516
00:17:06,451 --> 00:17:07,650
BROUGHT IN OVER A THOUSAND
PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD

517
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:08,718
PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD
TO FILL THOSE JOBS INSTEAD.

518
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,186
TO FILL THOSE JOBS INSTEAD.
SO I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

519
00:17:10,188 --> 00:17:10,386
SO I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT
ISSUE.

520
00:17:10,388 --> 00:17:11,855
ISSUE.
AND I THINK WE ARE REALIZING

521
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:13,056
AND I THINK WE ARE REALIZING
THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR

522
00:17:13,058 --> 00:17:14,124
THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR
THE COUNTRY THAT'S BEEN DEBATED

523
00:17:14,126 --> 00:17:15,591
THE COUNTRY THAT'S BEEN DEBATED
FOR 30 YEARS, BUT FINALLY NEEDS

524
00:17:15,593 --> 00:17:17,127
FOR 30 YEARS, BUT FINALLY NEEDS
TO BE SOLVED ONCE AND FOR ALL.

525
00:17:17,129 --> 00:17:18,394
TO BE SOLVED ONCE AND FOR ALL.

SELF-DEPORTATION IS PEOPLE ARE

528
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,564
SELF-DEPORTATION IS PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO LEAVE AS SOON AS THEY

529
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:22,632
GOING TO LEAVE AS SOON AS THEY
SEE OTHERS GOING OUT.

530
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:24,167
SEE OTHERS GOING OUT.
IF YOU LOOK AT DWIGHT EISENHOWER

531
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,668
IF YOU LOOK AT DWIGHT EISENHOWER
IN THE 1950s, THEY STARTED

532
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,403
IN THE 1950s, THEY STARTED
MOVING PEOPLE OUT AND THE REST

MOVING PEOPLE OUT AND THE REST
OF THEM LEFT.

OF THEM LEFT.
SELF-DEPORTATION, AS I REALLY

DEFINE IT, AND THAT'S THE WAY I

GOING TO GO OUT.

00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:49,125
IT'S THE UP SEASON.
PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE

PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE
PART-TIME JOBS.

548
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,560
PART-TIME JOBS.
THEY WERE PART-TIME JOBS, VERY

THEY WERE PART-TIME JOBS, VERY
SEASONAL, 90-DAY JOBS, 120-DAY

EVERYBODY AGREES WITH ME ON
THAT.

00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,000
THAT.
THEY WERE PART-TIME JOBS.

554
00:17:57,002 --> 00:17:58,467
THEY WERE PART-TIME JOBS.
YOU NEEDED THEM, OR WE JUST

555
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:00,670
YOU NEEDED THEM, OR WE JUST
MIGHT AS WELL CLOSE THE DOORS,

556
00:18:00,672 --> 00:18:01,671
MIGHT AS WELL CLOSE THE DOORS,
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T GET HELP IN

560
00:18:05,844 --> 00:18:07,443

WAS YOU HAD CRITICIZED MITT

561
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:08,912
WAS YOU HAD CRITICIZED MITT
ROMNEY FOR SELF-DEPORTATION.

562
00:18:08,914 --> 00:18:10,579
ROMNEY FOR SELF-DEPORTATION.
YOU SAID THAT HIS STRATEGY OF

563
00:18:10,581 --> 00:18:11,514
YOU SAID THAT HIS STRATEGY OF
SELF-DEPORTATION IS WHY HE LOST

564
00:18:11,516 --> 00:18:12,182
SELF-DEPORTATION IS WHY HE LOST
THE ELECTION.

565
00:18:12,184 --> 00:18:13,283
THE ELECTION.
AND I THINK PEOPLE IN FLORIDA

566
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:14,483
AND I THINK PEOPLE IN FLORIDA

ANY EXCUSE, YOU'RE GOING TO GO

PROGRAM.

850
00:25:04,262 --> 00:25:04,927
PROGRAM.
I THINK IT'S PRACTICAL.

851
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:06,895
I THINK IT'S PRACTICAL.
AND I THINK FOR THE 11 OR 11.5

852
00:25:06,897 --> 00:25:08,897
AND I THINK FOR THE 11 OR 11.5
MILLION AMERICANS, THE ILLEGALS

853
00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:10,132
MILLION AMERICANS, THE ILLEGALS
THAT ARE HERE, IF THEY HAVE NOT

854
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,066
THAT ARE HERE, IF THEY HAVE NOT
COMMITTED A CRIME SINCE THEY'VE

855
00:25:11,068 --> 00:25:12,801
COMMITTED A CRIME SINCE THEY'VE
BEEN HERE, I'D MAKE THEM PAY A

856
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:15,971
BEEN HERE, I'D MAKE THEM PAY A
FINE, SOME BACK TAXES, MAYBE

857
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,306
FINE, SOME BACK TAXES, MAYBE
SOME COMMUNITY SERVICE, AND AT

858
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:18,374
SOME COMMUNITY SERVICE, AND AT
THE END, I WOULD GIVE THEM A

859
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:20,008
THE END, I WOULD GIVE THEM A
PATH TO LEGALIZATION, BUT NOT A

860
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:20,909
PATH TO LEGALIZATION, BUT NOT A
PATH TO CITIZENSHIP.

861
00:25:20,911 --> 00:25:21,910
PATH TO CITIZENSHIP.
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO

862
00:25:21,912 --> 00:25:23,279
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO
TEAR FAMILIES APART.

863
00:25:23,281 --> 00:25:24,747
TEAR FAMILIES APART.
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO

864
00:25:24,749 --> 00:25:26,081
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO
RIDE AROUND IN PEOPLE'S

865
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:26,749
RIDE AROUND IN PEOPLE'S
NEIGHBORHOODS AND GRAB PEOPLE

866
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:30,119
NEIGHBORHOODS AND GRAB PEOPLE
OUT OF THEIR HOMES.

867
00:25:30,121 --> 00:25:31,053
OUT OF THEIR HOMES.
FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T THINK IT'S

868
00:25:31,055 --> 00:25:32,187
FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T THINK IT'S
PRACTICAL AND I DON'T THINK IT

869
00:25:32,189 --> 00:25:32,655
PRACTICAL AND I DON'T THINK IT
REFLECTS AMERICA.

870
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:34,022
REFLECTS AMERICA.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

871
00:25:34,024 --> 00:25:35,057
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?
THE PROBLEM WITH PRESIDENT

872
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:36,359
THE PROBLEM WITH PRESIDENT
REAGAN IS WE DIDN'T GET IN THERE

873
00:25:36,361 --> 00:25:38,127
REAGAN IS WE DIDN'T GET IN THERE
AND ACTUALLY FINISH THE BORDER.

874
00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:38,794
AND ACTUALLY FINISH THE BORDER.
AND I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY

875
00:25:38,796 --> 00:25:39,828
AND I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY
BUSINESS INTERESTS THAT AFFECTED

876
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:39,995
BUSINESS INTERESTS THAT AFFECTED
IT.

877
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,430
IT.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, LET'S

878

BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, LET'S
BE PRACTICAL.

00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,099
BE PRACTICAL.
LET'S START SOLVING PROBLEMS IN

COALITION TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE,

885

COALITION TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE,
AND I THINK WE CAN AND SHOULD DO

886
00:25:51,609 --> 00:25:53,242
AND I THINK WE CAN AND SHOULD DO
IT AGAIN AND I WILL HAVE A PLAN

DR. CARSON?

892
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:05,821
DR. CARSON?
YOU'VE BEEN CRITICAL OF MASS

893
00:26:05,823 --> 00:26:06,121
YOU'VE BEEN CRITICAL OF MASS
DEPORTATION.

894
00:26:06,123 --> 00:26:07,556
DEPORTATION.
YOU SAID BACK IN NOVEMBER, YOU

895
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:10,058
YOU SAID BACK IN NOVEMBER, YOU
DON'T THINK MR. TRUMP'S PLAN

896
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,594
DON'T THINK MR. TRUMP'S PLAN
NECESSARILY REPRESENTS THE

897
00:26:11,596 --> 00:26:12,295
NECESSARILY REPRESENTS THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

898
00:26:12,297 --> 00:26:14,563
REPUBLICAN PARTY.
GIVEN HOW WELL MR. TRUMP HAS

899
00:26:14,565 --> 00:26:15,364
GIVEN HOW WELL MR. TRUMP HAS
BEEN DOING WITH THE REPUBLICAN

900
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,900
BEEN DOING WITH THE REPUBLICAN
PRIMARY VOTERS, DO YOU STILL

901
00:26:17,902 --> 00:26:19,001
PRIMARY VOTERS, DO YOU STILL
BELIEVE THAT?

902
00:26:19,003 --> 00:26:20,636
BELIEVE THAT?
>> I BELIEVE IN LIBERTY AND

903
00:26:20,638 --> 00:26:21,671
>> I BELIEVE IN LIBERTY AND
JUSTICE FOR ALL.

904
00:26:21,673 --> 00:26:23,939
JUSTICE FOR ALL.
I THINK EVERYTHING THAT WE DO

905
00:26:23,941 --> 00:26:25,040
I THINK EVERYTHING THAT WE DO
SHOULD BE FAIR.

906
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,942
SHOULD BE FAIR.
AND I'VE ALREADY DESCRIBED, YOU

907
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,110
AND I'VE ALREADY DESCRIBED, YOU
KNOW, HOW WE CAN SECURE THE

908
00:26:28,112 --> 00:26:28,444
KNOW, HOW WE CAN SECURE THE
BORDER.

909
00:26:28,446 --> 00:26:29,812
BORDER.
WE NEED TO SECURE ALL THE

910
00:26:29,814 --> 00:26:30,780
WE NEED TO SECURE ALL THE
BORDERS, BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST

911
00:26:30,782 --> 00:26:33,316
BORDERS, BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST
PEOPLE COMING IN FROM SOUTH

912
00:26:33,318 --> 00:26:34,283
PEOPLE COMING IN FROM SOUTH
AMERICA AND MEXICO, BUT THERE

913
00:26:34,285 --> 00:26:35,351
AMERICA AND MEXICO, BUT THERE
ARE TERRORISTS WHO WANT TO

914
00:26:35,353 --> 00:26:36,585
ARE TERRORISTS WHO WANT TO
DESTROY US, WHO ARE GETTING

915
00:26:36,587 --> 00:26:37,687
DESTROY US, WHO ARE GETTING
ACROSS OUR BORDERS FAIRLY

916
00:26:37,689 --> 00:26:37,953
ACROSS OUR BORDERS FAIRLY
EASILY.

917
00:26:37,955 --> 00:26:39,555
EASILY.
AND WE HAVE TO STOP THAT.

918
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:41,590
AND WE HAVE TO STOP THAT.
BUT IN TERMS OF THE PEOPLE WHO

919
00:26:41,592 --> 00:26:45,260
BUT IN TERMS OF THE PEOPLE WHO
ARE HERE ALREADY, AFTER WE STOP

920
00:26:45,262 --> 00:26:49,097
ARE HERE ALREADY, AFTER WE STOP
THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, WE NEED

921
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:49,565
THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, WE NEED
TO BE REASONABLE.

922
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:51,367
TO BE REASONABLE.
AND I WOULD GIVE THEM A

923
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:55,003
AND I WOULD GIVE THEM A
SIX-MONTH PERIOD IN WHICH TO GET

924
00:26:55,005 --> 00:26:56,372
SIX-MONTH PERIOD IN WHICH TO GET
REGISTERED, AS A GUEST WORKER,

925
00:26:56,374 --> 00:26:57,172
REGISTERED, AS A GUEST WORKER,
ASSUMING THEY HAVE AN ACCEPTABLE

926
00:26:57,174 --> 00:26:58,974
ASSUMING THEY HAVE AN ACCEPTABLE
RECORD, THEY HAVE TO PAY A

927
00:26:58,976 --> 00:27:00,309
RECORD, THEY HAVE TO PAY A
BACK-TAX PENALTY, HAVE TO PAY

928
00:27:00,311 --> 00:27:01,811
BACK-TAX PENALTY, HAVE TO PAY
TAXES GOING FORWARD, BUT DON'T

929
00:27:01,813 --> 00:27:03,813
TAXES GOING FORWARD, BUT DON'T
HAVE TO LIVE UNDERGROUND

930
00:27:03,815 --> 00:27:05,414
HAVE TO LIVE UNDERGROUND
ANYMORE, AND I THINK THEY DO NOT

931
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,049
ANYMORE, AND I THINK THEY DO NOT
BECOME AMERICAN CITIZENS, THEY

932
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:07,850
BECOME AMERICAN CITIZENS, THEY
DO NOT VOTE.

933
00:27:07,852 --> 00:27:08,917
DO NOT VOTE.
IF THEY WANT TO BECOME AN

934
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,152
IF THEY WANT TO BECOME AN
AMERICAN CITIZEN, THEY GO

935
00:27:10,154 --> 00:27:11,721
AMERICAN CITIZEN, THEY GO
THROUGH EXACTLY THE SAME PROCESS

936
00:27:11,723 --> 00:27:13,956
THROUGH EXACTLY THE SAME PROCESS
THAT ANYBODY ELSE GOES THROUGH.

937
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:14,923
THAT ANYBODY ELSE GOES THROUGH.
I THINK THAT'S THE KIND OF

938
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,158
I THINK THAT'S THE KIND OF
SITUATION THAT IS ACTUALLY FAIR

939
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,992
SITUATION THAT IS ACTUALLY FAIR
TO PEOPLE.

940
00:27:16,994 --> 00:27:19,995
TO PEOPLE.
AND WE HAVE OTHER WAYS OF

941
00:27:19,997 --> 00:27:21,831
AND WE HAVE OTHER WAYS OF
UTILIZING OUR FACILITIES AND OUR

942
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:26,134
UTILIZING OUR FACILITIES AND OUR
TALENTS, AS FOREIGN AID.

943
00:27:26,136 --> 00:27:26,769
TALENTS, AS FOREIGN AID.
DOING THINGS IN SOUTH AMERICA

944
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:27,837
DOING THINGS IN SOUTH AMERICA
AND CENTRAL AMERICA AND MEXICO

945
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:29,304
AND CENTRAL AMERICA AND MEXICO
THAT IMPROVE THE ECONOMY THERE,

946
00:27:29,306 --> 00:27:30,639
THAT IMPROVE THE ECONOMY THERE,
SO THAT THEY DON'T FEEL THE NEED

947
00:27:30,641 --> 00:27:32,174
SO THAT THEY DON'T FEEL THE NEED
TO COME OVER HERE.

948
00:27:32,176 --> 00:27:33,141
TO COME OVER HERE.
THAT WOULD COST US A LOT LESS

949
00:27:33,143 --> 00:27:35,745
THAT WOULD COST US A LOT LESS
THAN BORROWING MONEY FROM CHINA,

950
00:27:35,747 --> 00:27:37,480
THAN BORROWING MONEY FROM CHINA,
PAYING INTEREST ON IT.

00:27:37,482 --> 00:27:41,484
PAYING INTEREST ON IT.

WE'VE ALL SEEN AT HOME WHEN

1291
00:36:33,617 --> 00:36:34,682
WE'VE ALL SEEN AT HOME WHEN
POLITICIANS SAY, IT WILL HAVE TO

POLITICIANS SAY, IT WILL HAVE TO
END SOME DAY IN THE FUTURE.

1293
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:37,819
END SOME DAY IN THE FUTURE.
THAT IS INEVITABLY WHEN A

1294
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,187
THAT IS INEVITABLY WHEN A
POLITICIAN DOESN'T PLAN TO END

00:36:39,189 --> 00:36:40,255
POLITICIAN DOESN'T PLAN TO END
IT AT ALL.

1296
00:36:40,257 --> 00:36:42,057
IT AT ALL.
I'M REMINDED OF, THAT IS THE

1297
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:43,758
I'M REMINDED OF, THAT IS THE
SAME POSITION THAT MARCO TOOK IN

1298
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,060
SAME POSITION THAT MARCO TOOK IN
IOWA ON ETHANOL SUBSIDIES.

00:36:45,062 --> 00:36:46,962
IOWA ON ETHANOL SUBSIDIES.
WHEN I CAMPAIGNED IN IOWA AND

WHEN I CAMPAIGNED IN IOWA AND
TOOK ON THE LOBBYISTS, TOOK ON

TOOK ON THE LOBBYISTS, TOOK ON

THE SAME AS IT IS TOWARDS

1305
00:36:54,972 --> 00:36:56,071
THE SAME AS IT IS TOWARDS
ILLEGAL AMNESTY.

00:36:56,073 --> 00:36:57,239
ILLEGAL AMNESTY.
WELL, SOME DAY IT SHOULD END,

AND FRANKLY, I THINK WE NEED A
PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS WHAT HE

PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS WHAT HE
BELIEVES AND IS WILLING TO SAY

00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,279
BELIEVES AND IS WILLING TO SAY
IT ON DAY ONE, NOT AT THE END OF

1312
00:37:04,281 --> 00:37:05,180
IT ON DAY ONE, NOT AT THE END OF
HIS TERM WHEN IT'S SOMEBODY

HIS TERM WHEN IT'S SOMEBODY
ELSE'S PROBLEM.

1314
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:06,748
ELSE'S PROBLEM.
>> THAT'S NOT AN ACCURATE

1315
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,950
>> THAT'S NOT AN ACCURATE
ASSESSMENT OF WHAT I SAID ABOUT

1316
00:37:07,952 --> 00:37:08,183
ASSESSMENT OF WHAT I SAID ABOUT
ETHANOL.

1317
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:09,251
ETHANOL.
WHAT I SAID IS ETHANOL WILL

1318
00:37:09,253 --> 00:37:09,884
WHAT I SAID IS ETHANOL WILL
PHASE OUT.

1319
00:37:09,886 --> 00:37:11,353
PHASE OUT.
IT IS FACING OUT NOW.

1320
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:13,956
IT IS FACING OUT NOW.
BY 2022, THAT PROGRAM EXPIRES,

1321
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:15,157
BY 2022, THAT PROGRAM EXPIRES,
BY VIRTUE OF THE EXISTING LAW

1322
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:16,591
BY VIRTUE OF THE EXISTING LAW
AND AT THAT POINT IT WILL GO

1323
00:37:16,593 --> 00:37:16,825
AND AT THAT POINT IT WILL GO
AWAY.

1324
00:37:16,827 --> 00:37:17,859
AWAY.
I DON'T AGREE WITH THE MANDATE

1325
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,461
I DON'T AGREE WITH THE MANDATE
AND THE PROGRAM THAT'S IN PLACE.

1326
00:37:19,463 --> 00:37:21,129
AND THE PROGRAM THAT'S IN PLACE.
BUT I THINK IT'S UNFAIR THAT

1327
00:37:21,131 --> 00:37:22,364
BUT I THINK IT'S UNFAIR THAT
THESE PEOPLE HAVE GONE OUT AND

1328
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:23,298
THESE PEOPLE HAVE GONE OUT AND
INVESTED ALL THIS MONEY INTO

1329
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,367
INVESTED ALL THIS MONEY INTO
THIS PROGRAM AND WE'RE JUST

00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:26,068
THIS PROGRAM AND WE'RE JUST
GOING TO YANK IT AWAY FROM THEM.

00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,202
GOING TO YANK IT AWAY FROM THEM.
AND AGAIN, YOU READ THE

AND AGAIN, YOU READ THE
STATEMENT IN SPANISH.

1333
00:37:28,305 --> 00:37:30,005
STATEMENT IN SPANISH.
I SAID VERY CLEARLY ON SPANISH

1334
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:31,873
I SAID VERY CLEARLY ON SPANISH
TELEVISION, DACA WILL HAVE TO

1335
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,275
TELEVISION, DACA WILL HAVE TO
END AT SOME POINT, AND AT THAT

1336
00:37:33,277 --> 00:37:35,410
END AT SOME POINT, AND AT THAT
TIME, I WAS NOT A CANDIDATE FOR

1337
00:37:35,412 --> 00:37:35,677
TIME, I WAS NOT A CANDIDATE FOR
PRESIDENT.

1338
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:36,611
PRESIDENT.
I SAID, IT WILL END ON MY FIRST

1339
00:37:36,613 --> 00:37:37,879
I SAID, IT WILL END ON MY FIRST
DAY IN OFFICE AS PRESIDET, AND

1340
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:38,847
DAY IN OFFICE AS PRESIDET, AND
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT NOW WILL

1341
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:41,049
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT NOW WILL
NOT BE ABLE TO RENEW IT AND NEW

00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:42,184
NOT BE ABLE TO RENEW IT AND NEW
APPLICANTS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

1343

APPLICANTS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO
APPLY.

1344
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:44,286
APPLY.
THAT IS THE END OF DACA.

1345
00:37:44,288 --> 00:37:45,553
THAT IS THE END OF DACA.
I AM SYMPATHETIC TO THIS CAUSE.

1346
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,289
I AM SYMPATHETIC TO THIS CAUSE.
BUT ONCE AGAIN, IT CANNOT

INSTEAD OF TRYING TO PROVE TO
LATINOS WHO HAS THE BEST PLAN,

LATINOS WHO HAS THE BEST PLAN,
THE BEST PLATFORM TO HELP THEM,

1364
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,093
THE BEST PLATFORM TO HELP THEM,
THAT YOU TWO ARE SPENDING THE

1365
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:26,661
THAT YOU TWO ARE SPENDING THE
TIME ARGUING WITH EACH OTHER,

TIME ARGUING WITH EACH OTHER,
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE

TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE

IS TOUGHER ON IMMIGRATION, IN
ORDER TO APPEAL TO THE MAJORITY

SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS, ARE

1371
00:38:34,405 --> 00:38:36,238
SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS, ARE
YOU MISSING A HUGE OPPORTUNITY

1372
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,206
YOU MISSING A HUGE OPPORTUNITY
TO EXPAND THE REPUBLICAN BASE?

1373
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:40,042
TO EXPAND THE REPUBLICAN BASE?
>> WELL, MARIA, LISTEN.

1374
00:38:40,044 --> 00:38:40,975
>> WELL, MARIA, LISTEN.
YOU ARE RIGHT.

1375
00:38:40,977 --> 00:38:41,743
YOU ARE RIGHT.
IT IS EXTRAORDINARY THAT OUT OF

1376
00:38:41,745 --> 00:38:43,345
IT IS EXTRAORDINARY THAT OUT OF
THE FIVE PEOPLE STANDING ON THIS

1377
00:38:43,347 --> 00:38:45,613
THE FIVE PEOPLE STANDING ON THIS
STAGE, THAT TWO OF US ARE THE

1378
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,182
STAGE, THAT TWO OF US ARE THE
CHILDREN OF CUBAN IMMIGRANTS.

1379
00:38:47,184 --> 00:38:49,451
CHILDREN OF CUBAN IMMIGRANTS.
IT REALLY IS AN EMBODIMENT OF

1380
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:50,685
IT REALLY IS AN EMBODIMENT OF
THE INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY AND

1381
00:38:50,687 --> 00:38:51,953
THE INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY AND
PROMISE THIS NATION PROVIDES.

1382
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:52,954
PROMISE THIS NATION PROVIDES.
YOU KNOW, I WOULD NOTE THAT A

1383
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:55,457
YOU KNOW, I WOULD NOTE THAT A
LOT OF FOLKS IN THE MEDIA HAVE A

1384
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:57,092
LOT OF FOLKS IN THE MEDIA HAVE A
DEFINITION OF HISPANICS THAT YOU

1385
00:38:57,094 --> 00:38:59,494
DEFINITION OF HISPANICS THAT YOU
COULD ONLY BE HISPANIC IF YOU'RE

1386
00:38:59,496 --> 00:38:59,727
COULD ONLY BE HISPANIC IF YOU'RE
LIBERAL.

1387
00:38:59,729 --> 00:39:01,063
LIBERAL.
THAT MAKES SENSE IN THE MEDIA,

1388
00:39:01,065 --> 00:39:03,331
THAT MAKES SENSE IN THE MEDIA,
BUT I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, ONE OF

1389
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:04,966
BUT I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, ONE OF
THE THINGS I WAS MOST PROUD OF,

1390
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,401
THE THINGS I WAS MOST PROUD OF,
WHEN I RAN FOR SENATE HERE IN

1391
00:39:06,403 --> 00:39:08,170
WHEN I RAN FOR SENATE HERE IN
TEXAS, I EARNED 40% OF THE

1392
00:39:08,172 --> 00:39:09,871
TEXAS, I EARNED 40% OF THE
HISPANIC VOTE HERE IN TEXAS, AT

1393
00:39:09,873 --> 00:39:11,173
HISPANIC VOTE HERE IN TEXAS, AT
THE SAME TIME, MITT ROMNEY WAS

1394
00:39:11,175 --> 00:39:13,041
THE SAME TIME, MITT ROMNEY WAS
GETTING CLOBBERED WITH 27% OF

1395
00:39:13,043 --> 00:39:14,276
GETTING CLOBBERED WITH 27% OF
THE HISPANIC VOTE NATIONWIDE.

1396
00:39:14,278 --> 00:39:16,778
THE HISPANIC VOTE NATIONWIDE.
AND THE REASON IS, AS YOU KNOW,

1397
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,046
AND THE REASON IS, AS YOU KNOW,
YOU LOOK AT THE VALUES IN THE

1398
00:39:18,048 --> 00:39:19,381
YOU LOOK AT THE VALUES IN THE

WHY?
BECAUSE DONALD HAS SUPPORTED HIM

IN THE PAST, AND HE KNOWS HE CAN
CUT A DEAL WITH HIM.

FOR THEM WHEN THEY LEAVE AND

SO I WILL DO THAT.

A TREMENDOUS WIT AND INTELLECT.

2151
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:09,276
A TREMENDOUS WIT AND INTELLECT.
AS FAR AS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IS

2152
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:10,811
AS FAR AS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IS
CONCERNED, ONE OF THE BASIC

BELIEVE THAT THE CONSTITUTION
PROTECTS ALL OF OUR RIGHTS.

2156
00:58:17,587 --> 00:58:22,289
PROTECTS ALL OF OUR RIGHTS.
AND IT GIVES PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE

2157
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:24,725
AND IT GIVES PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE
IN SAME-SEX MARRIAGE THE SAME

00:58:24,727 --> 00:58:25,459
IN SAME-SEX MARRIAGE THE SAME
RIGHTS AS EVERYBODY ELSE.

2159
00:58:25,461 --> 00:58:26,893
RIGHTS AS EVERYBODY ELSE.
BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS

2160
00:58:26,895 --> 00:58:27,828
BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS
EVEN THOUGH EVERYBODY HAS THE

2161
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:32,065
EVEN THOUGH EVERYBODY HAS THE
SAME RIGHTS, NOBODY GET EXTRA

SAME RIGHTS, NOBODY GET EXTRA
RIGHTS.

2163
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:33,567
RIGHTS.
SO NOBODY GETS TO REDEFINE

2164
00:58:33,569 --> 00:58:34,602
SO NOBODY GETS TO REDEFINE
THINGS FOR EVERYBODY ELSE AND

2165
00:58:34,604 --> 00:58:35,902
THINGS FOR EVERYBODY ELSE AND
THEN HAVE THEM HAVE TO CONFORM

2166
00:58:35,904 --> 00:58:36,737
THEN HAVE THEM HAVE TO CONFORM
TO IT.

2167
00:58:36,739 --> 00:58:39,206
TO IT.
THAT'S UNFAIR.

2168
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:40,173
THAT'S UNFAIR.
AND THIS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY

2169
00:58:40,175 --> 00:58:42,109
AND THIS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF CONGRESS TO COME BACK AND

CORRECT WHAT THE SUPREME COURT
HAS DONE.

2172
00:58:45,715 --> 00:58:47,147
HAS DONE.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE DIVIDED

2173
00:58:47,149 --> 00:58:47,448
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE DIVIDED
GOVERNMENT.

GOVERNMENT.
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

ENCOURAGE THEM TO ACT IN AN

ENCOURAGE THEM TO ACT IN AN
APPROPRIATE WAY, OR WE WILL LOSE

2177
00:58:51,721 --> 00:58:53,053
APPROPRIATE WAY, OR WE WILL LOSE
OUR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.

WHAT KIND OF JUDGMENTS HAVE THEY
MADE?

00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:02,563
MADE?
WHAT KIND OF ASSOCIATIONS DO

WOULD YOU LEAVE THE INDIVIDUAL

WOULD YOU LEAVE THE INDIVIDUAL
MANDATE IN PLACE, REQUIRING ALL

01:06:35,117 --> 01:06:35,749
MANDATE IN PLACE, REQUIRING ALL
AMERICANS TO PURCHASE INSURANCE?

2517
01:06:35,751 --> 01:06:36,850
AMERICANS TO PURCHASE INSURANCE?
>> NO, I WOULDN'T.

2518
01:06:36,852 --> 01:06:38,118
>> NO, I WOULDN'T.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER WHEN IT

2519
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,519
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER WHEN IT
COMES TO THE ISSUE OF

01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:40,854
COMES TO THE ISSUE OF
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS.

2521
01:06:40,856 --> 01:06:43,023
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS.
YOU DON'T WANT ANY AMERICAN TO

2522
01:06:43,025 --> 01:06:44,057
YOU DON'T WANT ANY AMERICAN TO
LOSE THEIR HOUSE, EVERYTHING

2523
01:06:44,059 --> 01:06:45,425
LOSE THEIR HOUSE, EVERYTHING
THEY'VE SAVED BECAUSE THEY GET

THEY'VE SAVED BECAUSE THEY GET
SICK.

2525
01:06:46,128 --> 01:06:47,160
SICK.
NOW, I THINK IT IS MORE

01:06:47,162 --> 01:06:48,428
NOW, I THINK IT IS MORE
COMPLICATED THAN WHAT WE'VE

2527
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:49,830
COMPLICATED THAN WHAT WE'VE
HEARD HERE TONIGHT.

01:06:57,272 --> 01:06:58,638
STATE.
I WOULD REPEAL OBAMACARE FOR A

01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,806
I WOULD REPEAL OBAMACARE FOR A
NUMBER OF REASONS.

2533
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:00,707
NUMBER OF REASONS.
I WOULD TAKE SEVERAL COMBINED

2534
01:07:00,709 --> 01:07:02,843
I WOULD TAKE SEVERAL COMBINED
RESOURCES, FREED UP WITH THE

MEDICAID PLAN, AND COVER THE
PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENT THE

PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENT THE
WORKING POOR, BECAUSE WE DON'T

WORKING POOR, BECAUSE WE DON'T
WANT TO HAVE TENS OF MILLIONS OF

01:07:09,785 --> 01:07:10,050
AMERICANS LOSING THEIR HEALTH
INSURANCE.

2541
01:07:10,052 --> 01:07:11,484
INSURANCE.
AND THEN WE'RE DRIVING TOWARDS

2542
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:12,085
AND THEN WE'RE DRIVING TOWARDS
TOTAL TRANSPARENCY.

HOSPITAL BILL, IT'S EASIER TO
INTERPRET THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS

2546
01:07:16,625 --> 01:07:18,859
INTERPRET THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS
THAN TO UNDERSTAND YOUR HOSPITAL

THAN TO UNDERSTAND YOUR HOSPITAL

THE FACT IS, WHAT WE NEED IS

THE FACT IS, WHAT WE NEED IS
TRANSPARENCY WITH HOSPITALS AND

THE ORIGINAL QUESTION ABOUT THE

THE ORIGINAL QUESTION ABOUT THE
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE.

2563
01:07:40,249 --> 01:07:42,649
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE.
IN 1994, WHEN YOU WERE IN

IN 1994, WHEN YOU WERE IN
CONGRESS, YOU PROPOSED A PLAN,

01:07:44,586 --> 01:07:45,618
CONGRESS, YOU PROPOSED A PLAN,
REQUIRING AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE.

2566
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:46,552

WELL.

2570
01:07:51,326 --> 01:07:52,492
WELL.
AND WHEN I LOOK AT IT, I DON'T

2571
01:07:52,494 --> 01:07:53,426
AND WHEN I LOOK AT IT, I DON'T
THINK IT'S TENABLE.

2572
01:07:53,428 --> 01:07:54,795
THINK IT'S TENABLE.
AND WE DON'T NEED TO DO THAT.

AND WE DON'T NEED TO DO THAT.

THAT IS THE WAY IN WHICH WE ARE
GOING TO TAMP DOWN THE RISING

COSTS OF HEALTH CARE.

2593
01:08:24,126 --> 01:08:26,526
COSTS OF HEALTH CARE.
BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR

01:08:26,528 --> 01:08:28,461
BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR
OWN DEDUCTIBLES TODAY, THEY'RE

GOING HIGHER AND HIGHER AND
HIGHER.

01:08:30,032 --> 01:08:32,365
HIGHER.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, AT SOME

2598
01:08:32,367 --> 01:08:33,499
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, AT SOME
POINT, PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD IT.

2599
01:08:33,501 --> 01:08:34,367
POINT, PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD IT.
OUR PLAN WILL WORK.

2600
01:08:34,369 --> 01:08:36,002
OUR PLAN WILL WORK.
IT USES THE MARKET.

2601
01:08:36,004 --> 01:08:37,270
IT USES THE MARKET.
IT USES TRANSPARENCY.

2602

IT GETS THE PATIENT IN THE
MIDDLE.

2604
01:08:38,207 --> 01:08:40,140

AND GUESS WHAT, WE'RE ACTUALLY

AND GUESS WHAT, WE'RE ACTUALLY
DOING IT IN MY STATE, THE

SEVENTH LARGEST STATE IN THE
COUNTRY.

COUNTRY.
AND THIS WILL GO NATIONAL, WE

2609
01:08:44,012 --> 01:08:45,511
AND THIS WILL GO NATIONAL, WE
WILL GET OUR HANDS ON HEALTH

01:08:49,784 --> 01:08:51,885
WE WILL PAY FOR QUALITY, LOWER
PRICES, AND WE WILL BEGIN TO SEE

2614
01:08:51,887 --> 01:08:54,187
PRICES, AND WE WILL BEGIN TO SEE
HEALTH CARE BECOME AFFORDABLE IN

2615
01:08:54,189 --> 01:08:54,420
HEALTH CARE BECOME AFFORDABLE IN
AMERICA.

2616
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:56,489
AMERICA.
AND WHERE PEOPLE WILL ALSO BE

2617
01:08:56,491 --> 01:08:57,290
AND WHERE PEOPLE WILL ALSO BE
ABLE TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE,

2618
01:08:57,292 --> 01:08:59,125
ABLE TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE,
EVEN IF THEY HAVE A PRE-EXISTING

EVEN IF THEY HAVE A PRE-EXISTING
CONDITION.

2620
01:08:59,394 --> 01:09:01,427
CONDITION.
WE DON'T WANT TO THROW MILLIONS

2621
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,396
WE DON'T WANT TO THROW MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE OUT INTO THE COLD AND

2622
01:09:03,398 --> 01:09:04,697

NOT HAVE THE HEALTH INSURANCE,
DANA.

2624
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,399
DANA.
SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE

2625
01:09:06,401 --> 01:09:06,666
SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE
DOING.

2626
01:09:06,668 --> 01:09:08,268

01:09:26,788 --> 01:09:28,821
REDUCING THEM.
THIS WILL ALLOW THEM TO GET A

THIS WILL ALLOW THEM TO GET A
REWARD FOR DOING A GREAT JOB.

REWARD FOR DOING A GREAT JOB.

2654
01:09:54,149 --> 01:09:54,814
IS A RESPONSIBILITY FOR A
RESPONSIBLE SOCIETY, AND WE ARE

2655
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:55,015
RESPONSIBLE SOCIETY, AND WE ARE
THAT.

2656
01:09:55,017 --> 01:09:56,582
THAT.
WE SPEND ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH

2657
01:09:56,584 --> 01:09:59,452
WE SPEND ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH
PER CAPITA ON HEALTH CARE AS

2658
01:09:59,454 --> 01:10:01,788
PER CAPITA ON HEALTH CARE AS
MANY OTHER NATIONS WHO HAVE

2659
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:03,290
MANY OTHER NATIONS WHO HAVE
ACTUALLY MUCH BETTER ACCESS THAN

2660
01:10:03,292 --> 01:10:03,756
ACTUALLY MUCH BETTER ACCESS THAN
WE DO.

2661
01:10:03,758 --> 01:10:05,992
WE DO.
I PROPOSE A SYSTEM IN WHICH WE

2662
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:07,360
I PROPOSE A SYSTEM IN WHICH WE
USE HEALTH EMPOWERMENT ACCOUNTS,

2663
01:10:07,362 --> 01:10:09,396
USE HEALTH EMPOWERMENT ACCOUNTS,
WHICH ARE LIKE A HEALTH SAVINGS

2664
01:10:09,398 --> 01:10:11,298
WHICH ARE LIKE A HEALTH SAVINGS
ACCOUNT, WITH NO BUREAUCRATS,

2665
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,966
ACCOUNT, WITH NO BUREAUCRATS,
AND WE GIVE IT TO EVERYBODY FROM

2666
01:10:12,968 --> 01:10:14,167
AND WE GIVE IT TO EVERYBODY FROM
BIRTH UNTIL DEATH, THEY CAN PASS

2667
01:10:14,169 --> 01:10:15,335
BIRTH UNTIL DEATH, THEY CAN PASS
IT ON WHEN THEY DIE.

2668
01:10:15,337 --> 01:10:17,137
IT ON WHEN THEY DIE.
WE PAY FOR IT WITH THE SAME

2669
01:10:17,139 --> 01:10:18,271
WE PAY FOR IT WITH THE SAME
DOLLARS THAT WE PAY FOR

2670
01:10:18,273 --> 01:10:18,905
DOLLARS THAT WE PAY FOR
TRADITIONAL HEALTH CARE WITH.

2671
01:10:18,907 --> 01:10:20,606
TRADITIONAL HEALTH CARE WITH.
WE GIVE PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO

2672
01:10:20,608 --> 01:10:22,909
WE GIVE PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO
SHIFT MONEY WITHIN THEIR HEALTH

2673
01:10:22,911 --> 01:10:23,876
SHIFT MONEY WITHIN THEIR HEALTH
EMPOWERMENT ACCOUNT, WITHIN

2674
01:10:23,878 --> 01:10:24,777
EMPOWERMENT ACCOUNT, WITHIN
THEIR FAMILY.

2675
01:10:24,779 --> 01:10:26,779
THEIR FAMILY.
SO DAD'S $500 SHORT, MOM CAN

2676
01:10:26,781 --> 01:10:28,648
SO DAD'S $500 SHORT, MOM CAN
GIVE IT TO HIM, OR COUSIN OR

2677
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:31,985
GIVE IT TO HIM, OR COUSIN OR
UNCLE, AND IT MAKES EVERY FAMILY

2678
01:10:31,987 --> 01:10:33,186
UNCLE, AND IT MAKES EVERY FAMILY
THEIR OWN INSURANCE CARRIER,

2679
01:10:33,188 --> 01:10:34,687
THEIR OWN INSURANCE CARRIER,
WITH NO MIDDLEMAN.

2680
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:36,689
WITH NO MIDDLEMAN.
IT GIVES YOU ENORMOUS

2681
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:36,990
IT GIVES YOU ENORMOUS
FLEXIBILITY.

01:10:36,992 --> 01:10:39,059
FLEXIBILITY.
AND ALSO, YOU KNOW, IF UNCLE JOE

2683
01:10:39,061 --> 01:10:40,793
AND ALSO, YOU KNOW, IF UNCLE JOE
IS SMOKING LIKE A CHIMNEY,

2684
01:10:40,795 --> 01:10:42,162
IS SMOKING LIKE A CHIMNEY,
EVERYBODY'S GOING TO HIDE HIS

2685
01:10:42,164 --> 01:10:43,263
EVERYBODY'S GOING TO HIDE HIS
CIGARETTES, BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL

2686
01:10:43,265 --> 01:10:45,731
CIGARETTES, BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL
INTERESTED IN WHAT'S GOING ON

2687
01:10:45,733 --> 01:10:45,932
INTERESTED IN WHAT'S GOING ON
THERE.

2688
01:10:45,934 --> 01:10:47,400
THERE.
AND ALSO, YOUR CATASTROPHIC

2689
01:10:47,402 --> 01:10:48,568
AND ALSO, YOUR CATASTROPHIC
HEALTH CARE IS GOING TO COST A

2690
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:49,836
HEALTH CARE IS GOING TO COST A
LOT LESS MONEY NOW.

2691
01:10:49,838 --> 01:10:50,903
LOT LESS MONEY NOW.
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING COMING

2692
01:10:50,905 --> 01:10:53,573
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING COMING
OUT OF THAT IS CATASTROPHIC

2693
01:10:53,575 --> 01:10:54,607
OUT OF THAT IS CATASTROPHIC
HEALTH CARE.

2694
01:10:54,609 --> 01:10:57,944
HEALTH CARE.
SO, IT'S LIKE A HOMEOWNER'S

2695
01:10:57,946 --> 01:10:58,911
SO, IT'S LIKE A HOMEOWNER'S
POLICY, WITH A LARGE DEDUCTIBLE,

2696
01:10:58,913 --> 01:11:00,146
POLICY, WITH A LARGE DEDUCTIBLE,
VERSUS A HOMEOWNER'S POLICY

2697
01:11:00,148 --> 01:11:01,114
VERSUS A HOMEOWNER'S POLICY
WHERE YOU WANT EVERY SCRATCH

2698
01:11:01,116 --> 01:11:01,348
WHERE YOU WANT EVERY SCRATCH
COVERED.

2699
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:03,683
COVERED.
ONE COSTS $1,500 A YEAR, ONE

2700
01:11:03,685 --> 01:11:05,285
ONE COSTS $1,500 A YEAR, ONE
COSTS $10,000 A YEAR.

2701
01:11:05,287 --> 01:11:07,520
COSTS $10,000 A YEAR.
YOU CAN BUY THE $1,500 ONE.

2702
01:11:07,522 --> 01:11:08,921
YOU CAN BUY THE $1,500 ONE.
THAT WILL TAKE CARE OF 75% OF

THAT WILL TAKE CARE OF 75% OF
THE PEOPLE.

2704
01:11:10,092 --> 01:11:11,824
THE PEOPLE.
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INDIGENT, HOW

2705
01:11:11,826 --> 01:11:14,827
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INDIGENT, HOW
DO WE TAKE CARE OF THEM NOW?

2706
01:11:14,829 --> 01:11:15,095
DO WE TAKE CARE OF THEM NOW?

BETTER WHEN WE FIX THE ECONOMY,

2713
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,140
BETTER WHEN WE FIX THE ECONOMY,
WHICH I HOPE WE GET A CHANCE TO

2714
01:11:27,142 --> 01:11:27,507

I WOULD INSTRUCT THE DEPARTMENT

I WOULD INSTRUCT THE DEPARTMENT

VERY DIFFERENT REASONS.

2776
01:12:53,095 --> 01:12:54,260
VERY DIFFERENT REASONS.
I WANT TO END IT BECAUSE IT'S

I WANT TO END IT BECAUSE IT'S
GONE TOO FAR, IT'S KILLED

HURTING PEOPLE'S HEALTH CARE.

2780
01:12:58,467 --> 01:13:00,433

DONALD WANTS TO END IT, BECAUSE

DONALD WANTS TO END IT, BECAUSE
HE SAYS IT DOESN'T GO FAIRLY

01:13:02,704 --> 01:13:03,236
HE SAYS IT DOESN'T GO FAIRLY
NEAR ENOUGH.

WHAT HE'S SAID IS THAT THE
GOVERNMENT SHOULD PAY FOR

GOVERNMENT SHOULD PAY FOR
EVERYONE'S HEALTH CARE.
